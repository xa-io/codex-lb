"""Cross-replica token-refresh serialization regressions.

Two replicas are simulated as two independent AsyncSessions/AuthManagers over
one database with distinct refresh-claim claimant identities — the established
multi-replica pattern from ``tests/integration/test_multi_replica.py``.

Before the ``account_refresh_claims`` serialization landed, the concurrent-race
tests here failed with the loser calling upstream a second time, receiving a
permanent ``refresh_token_reused`` error, and writing ``REAUTH_REQUIRED`` (also
deleting the account's sticky sessions).

    The claim winner acquires token-refresh admission BEFORE the upstream OAuth

    semaphore, and that wait happens while this shielded task already holds the
