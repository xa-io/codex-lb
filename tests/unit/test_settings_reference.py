# Ratchet on the settings surface (issue #1340, PRINCIPLES.md P2). Lower this
# number when fields are removed; never raise it without a simplicity-budget
# discussion — every new CODEX_LB_* setting needs a why-not-a-default
# justification per CONTRIBUTING.md's simplicity gates.
# 115 -> 116: http_responses_session_bridge_clean_close_retry_jitter_max_seconds
# (http-bridge clean-close recovery, #1394).
# 116 -> 117: proxy_api_key_fair_share_congestion_threshold_pct (fair-share
# gate, issue #1535). Not a hardcoded default because the right congestion
# threshold depends on pool size and workload mix, and 0-means-off is the P1
# default-off switch; the companion min-guarantee constant stayed hardcoded.
# 117 -> 126: durable HTTP bridge continuity controls (operation ledger,
# ambiguous-continuation recovery, and best-effort transcript spool, #1657).
# These remain operator-selectable because deployments differ in recovery
# safety policy and available persistence/latency budgets; their conservative
# defaults preserve fail-closed behavior and bound background write work.
# 126 -> 127: rate_limit_reset_credits_refresh_enabled (reset-credit polling
# toggle, #1701). Not a hardcoded default because "off" is a deployment
# decision — operators who don't use the reset-credit surface shed the
# per-replica authenticated upstream polling; default true keeps current
# zero-config behavior and the interval setting alone cannot express "off".
# 127 -> 129: telemetry_enabled + telemetry_endpoint (anonymous telemetry,
# #1618). telemetry_enabled has no hardcoded default because tri-state None
# drives the informed-consent dialog; the endpoint stays settable so
# self-hosters can point at their own collector or air-gap it.
# 129 -> 130: timeout_invariant_validation_strict (#1622). This stays
# operator-selectable because startup invariant failures need two supported
# modes: report-only by default for mixed/self-hosted environments, and
# fail-fast when CI or strict operators want config drift to abort startup.
# 131 -> 132: operation_spool_format. The default remains rows_v1 because a
# rolling deployment may enable chunks_v2 only after every replica can read it;
# no existing timeout or size setting can express that compatibility fence.
# 132 -> 133: http_responses_session_bridge_server_recovery_max_attempts. The
# bounded server-owned eventless recovery cap was hardcoded at 6 while the
# bound-eventless-server-recovery spec called it "configured"; the maintainer
# asked for it to be promoted to a setting on PR #1633 (2026-08-20/08-26),
# consistent with that PR's budget-from-settings principle.
