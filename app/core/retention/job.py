    Rows above the rollup watermark are never deleted: their contribution
    exists only in the live table, so pruning them would silently shrink
    lifetime account totals. No watermark (fold never ran) means skip.

    The effective watermark is the MIN of the lifetime fold watermark and the
    hourly and conversation time-axis watermarks: a raw row is only prunable
    once EVERY rollup that must outlive it has folded it. While either
    time-axis backfill is catching up (each watermark starts at the epoch),
    the min fails the currency check below and pruning pauses entirely — the
    pre-existing "never delete what is not folded" invariant extended to the
    time-axis rollups.

    Pruning also requires the fold to be CURRENT (watermark within two fold
    lags of now) and stays a full fold lag below it. Summary reads load the
    watermark and the live tail in separate statements; a fold committing
    between them can advance the watermark, and deleting rows from that
    just-folded window would make the reader's tail miss rows its (older)
    folded sums never contained. A reader's loaded watermark is at most one
    steady-state fold advance behind the current one - far less than the
    fold lag - so rows a lag below a current watermark are safe; while the
    fold is catching up (initial backfill, stalled scheduler), skip
    entirely.
