# PostgreSQL evaluates the lease clock server-side so inter-replica wall-clock
# skew cannot steal a live lease. The stored expiry uses ``clock_timestamp()``
# (the actual statement-execution time) rather than ``now()`` /
# ``transaction_timestamp()`` (fixed at transaction start): a renewal or
# same-leader re-acquire that blocks on the ``scheduler_leader`` row lock must
# extend from the CURRENT time, not from a timestamp captured before it waited.
# Because the row lock serializes writers, ``clock_timestamp()`` is evaluated in
# commit order, so a slow writer that committed after a newer one can never
# write an earlier ``expires_at`` — the lease can only move forward. The
# conflict-update path recomputes ``clock_timestamp()`` in the ``DO UPDATE SET``
# clause rather than copying ``excluded.*``: the ``excluded`` row is the
# ``VALUES`` tuple, evaluated before the statement blocked on the row lock, so
# reusing it would stamp a pre-wait expiry and reintroduce the stale-clock race.
# The
# takeover predicate keeps the transaction snapshot clock (``now()``): the
# takeover decision is a single point-in-time read and staying on the snapshot
# is the conservative choice (a waiter never over-eagerly steals a lease that
# was refreshed while it was blocked on the lock).
#
# ``RETURNING`` reports the lease STILL REMAINING (``expires_at`` minus the
# database's OWN clock, ``clock_timestamp()``, in the same statement) so the
# caller can anchor its local monotonic deadline to the database's authoritative
# remaining lease rather than to a Python instant. Both the stored expiry and
# the returned ``db_now`` come from the one server clock, so the remaining is
# correct regardless of how long the statement waited on the row lock. A
# conflict no-op (another replica owns an unexpired lease) matches no row and
# RETURNS nothing, so the caller reads it as "not acquired". See ``try_acquire``
# for why anchoring a POST-statement monotonic instant to this remaining fixes
# both the backdate (a pre-statement instant seeds an already-expired deadline
# after a lock wait) and the outrun (a post-commit instant overshoots the DB
# expiry) failure modes at once.

# SQLite evaluates the lease clock inside the statement using its OWN
# execution-time clock, mirroring the PostgreSQL ``clock_timestamp()`` fix
# above. A shared SQLite file implies a single host, so there is one clock
# domain — but a renewal or same-leader re-acquire can still sit behind SQLite's
# single-writer lock (``busy_timeout``, default ~30s) for far longer than the
# lease TTL (the minimum is 5s). Binding a Python ``now`` captured BEFORE
# ``session.execute`` would then evaluate the unexpired-lease guard AND the new
# ``expires_at`` against a STALE pre-wait instant once the write lock is finally
# acquired: a heartbeat that should have lost the lease could still match and
# extend the row, running leader-gated work past the real TTL and overlapping
# failover. Computing the clock in-SQL removes that gap — SQLite evaluates
# ``'now'`` once per ``sqlite3_step()`` (every ``strftime(..., 'now')`` in one
# statement shares that single instant, so the guard predicate and the ``SET``
# expiry stay in one clock domain) and only after the write lock is actually
# held, exactly like ``clock_timestamp()`` on PostgreSQL. ``strftime('%Y-%m-%d
# %H:%M:%f', 'now')`` renders a 3-digit-millisecond fractional field;
# ``|| '000'`` pads it to the 6-digit-microsecond WIDTH SQLAlchemy's
# ``DateTime`` persists, so the stored string stays lexicographically
# comparable with existing rows and with the acquire path. SQLite's ``'now'``
# is UTC, matching the naive-UTC wall clock SQLAlchemy writes for the tz-aware
# ``expires_at`` column, so no extra anchoring is needed. The takeover
# predicate necessarily shares this same execution-time clock (SQLite has no

        keeps renewing the lease on the heartbeat cadence. A body detached on
        the graceful-shutdown path is still the rightful leader, and with a
        short TTL (the minimum is 5s) the DB lease would otherwise expire
        during the drain wait — a follower could then acquire it and run the
        same singleton work concurrently with the still-draining body. Renewing
        while waiting keeps the lease alive for as long as the detached body may
        still act as leader. If any body is still draining after the grace, the
        row is left in place — the lease then expires after its TTL, roughly one
        more TTL past the last renewal, after which the body is treated as
        abandoned — because handing it to a follower while old gated work still
        runs would recreate the duplicate-singleton overlap the lease exists to
        prevent.

        Renewal ownership is handed off from the shutdown keeper (see
        :meth:`start_release_keeper`, started at shutdown-begin so the lease is
        renewed continuously through the whole scheduler stop sequence). The
        keeper is stopped FIRST so exactly one owner renews at a time: the keeper
        renewed within the last interval, so the lease is still valid across the
        synchronous handoff, and :meth:`_drain_detached_bodies` then renews on
        the same cadence while it waits. Stopping the keeper before the drain
        (rather than after) keeps a single renewal owner rather than two writers
        racing on the row.

        Failure to release must never block shutdown; the lease then simply
        expires after the TTL.

        BEGINS with enough budget to FINISH before the locally tracked lease
        deadline: the sleep is bounded by ``remaining - renew_timeout`` (clamped
        to ``[0, renew_interval]``) so that ``sleep + renew_timeout`` lands at or
        before the deadline. A lease seeded from a preserved acquire may have
        less than a renew interval — even less than a whole renewal time-box —
        left; sleeping the full interval (or the whole remaining) would start
        ``renew()`` at/after the deadline, so its time-box would run while the
        database row has already expired and the gated body would keep acting as
        leader for up to ``renew_timeout`` past the DB expiry while a follower is
        free to acquire the row. Each renewal attempt is time-boxed to
        ``ttl / 6``, and the wait is additionally bounded so it never extends
        past the local deadline: a renewal still in flight at the deadline is
        abandoned and demoted rather than left running, so the gated body is
        cancelled the instant the deadline is reached with no successful
        renewal. Two consecutive failed attempts, or any failed attempt at/after
        the locally tracked lease deadline, demote the holder no later than the
        lease TTL — EXCEPT when a concurrent heartbeat on this shared
        ``LeaderElection`` has advanced ``self._lease_deadline`` past this
        heartbeat's local deadline: because the election is a shared singleton
        across every scheduler, clearing the shared leadership on one
        heartbeat's local transient errors would cancel a sibling's still-valid
        leader work and make its next ``renew`` return ``False`` even though the
        DB lease is freshly held. In that case this heartbeat adopts the
        sibling's fresher deadline and keeps renewing; the shared flag is cleared
        only on an authoritative rowcount-0 loss or a genuinely expired shared
        lease. The time-box is enforced with ``asyncio.wait`` (not
        ``asyncio.wait_for``) so a renewal whose cancellation cleanup itself
        stalls — e.g. a blocked rollback in session teardown — cannot pin the
        heartbeat past the timeout: once the timeout elapses the attempt is
        abandoned and counted as an error immediately, without awaiting the
        renewal coroutine's unwinding. On lease loss
        the body is cancelled and awaited for at most
        ``_CANCEL_GRACE_SECONDS``; a body still draining shielded work after
        the grace is detached (its outcome is logged from a done callback),
        so ``run_if_leader`` itself returns within the grace of the loss.

        When ``run_if_leader`` is instead cancelled externally (graceful
        shutdown) while the lease is still held, the heartbeat keeps renewing
        the lease until the gated body has drained (bounded by the cancel
        grace); the heartbeat is stopped only after the body exits, so a body
        that honours cancellation slower than the remaining lease TTL cannot let
        the DB lease expire while it still runs as leader. If the body still has
        not exited when the cancel grace elapses it is detached (and the
        heartbeat stops), but the lease is not abandoned: ``release`` keeps
        renewing it on the same cadence while it waits for the detached body to
        drain, so the DB lease still cannot expire while a detached body may act
        as leader.
