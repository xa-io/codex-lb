"""Clock and scheduler seams for deterministic proxy lifecycle tests.

Production code reads time and schedules timers/tasks through these two
protocols so a test can substitute a virtual implementation
(``tests/simulation/virtual_time.py``) and drive a whole proxy turn without
wall-clock sleeps. The real adapters are *verbatim* passthroughs: every
``RealScheduler`` method is the corresponding ``asyncio``/``anyio`` call with
no task registry, no extra timeout and no wrapper task, so injecting the
defaults changes nothing about production behavior. The scheduler's timing
and spawn members *are* the ``asyncio``/``anyio`` functions (``staticmethod``
aliases), so the per-event relay sites (``scheduler.create_task`` and
``scheduler.wait`` per upstream message, ``scheduler.wait_for(queue.get(), ...)``
per delivered block) pay neither a wrapper frame nor a bound-method allocation
over the raw call.

Usage rules (also enforced by ``scripts/check_proxy_timing_seams.py`` once it
lands):

* Objects that own the collaborators (``ProxyService``, ``LoadBalancer``,
  ``WorkAdmissionController``) use ``self._scheduler`` / ``self._clock``.
* Mixin methods and module functions that receive an owner read the seam with
  ``scheduler_for(owner)`` / ``clock_for(owner)``; partial doubles without the
  attribute keep the production default.
* Owner-less turn-path functions take keyword-only ``scheduler`` / ``clock``
  parameters that callers pass explicitly.
* ``asyncio.sleep(0)`` is a yield point, not a timer, and stays raw.

    cancel production work. Ownership tracking exists only in the virtual
    scheduler used by tests.

    The per-event members are the primitives themselves, bound as
    ``staticmethod`` so ``scheduler.create_task(...)`` compiles to the raw
    ``asyncio.create_task(...)`` call: no Python frame and no bound-method
    object per seam call on the relay paths (``create_task`` + ``wait`` per
    upstream message, ``wait_for`` per delivered block). The aliases bind at
    import, so a test that needs to observe or replace a timed wait must
    subclass this class or inject a virtual scheduler (``tests/simulation``);
    monkeypatching ``asyncio.wait`` afterwards does not reach them.
    ``tests/unit/test_clock_real_parity.py`` pins the identities. ``sleep``
    stays a one-frame wrapper: ``asyncio.sleep`` is overloaded on ``result``
    in typeshed, which ty 0.0.73 cannot match against the protocol member,
