    losing the final unflushed WAL window (bounded by three times
    ``wal_writer_delay`` — up to ~600 ms at the default 200 ms setting) keeps
    accounting semantics identical. For such transactions this helper emits
    ``SET LOCAL synchronous_commit = off`` so the commit returns without
    waiting for the WAL flush.

    ``SET LOCAL`` is transaction-scoped: PostgreSQL reverts it automatically
    at COMMIT/ROLLBACK, so nothing leaks onto the pooled connection. Executed
    outside a transaction, PostgreSQL merely emits a WARNING and the setting
    never applies — calling this through an ``AsyncSession`` is what makes it
    safe, because session autobegin opens the write transaction at this very
    statement when none is open yet.

    No-op on SQLite (durability there is governed by ``PRAGMA synchronous``).
    MUST NOT be used for configuration writes (accounts, API keys, settings,

    settlement, stale release): on external/HA PostgreSQL a server failover
    does not kill in-flight application requests, so an acked-but-lost
