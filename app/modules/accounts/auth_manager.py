        """Persist freshly rotated tokens through a *guarded* compare-and-set only.

        Returns the latest account row to adopt when a peer committed a
        genuinely newer refresh-token rotation (different material) — that write
        must never be clobbered. Returns ``None`` when our own rotation was
        persisted (the caller then mirrors the new tokens onto its object), or
        when the row vanished.

        INVARIANT: there is NO unconditional token write anywhere in this
        helper. Every persist is a compare-and-set conditioned on the exact
        refresh-token ciphertext observed in the immediately-preceding read
        (``WHERE refresh_token_encrypted == :expected``). That comparison is
        atomic in the database, so there is no read->write gap: if ANYTHING
        changed the row after our read — a non-deterministic re-encryption of the
        same plaintext OR a genuine peer rotation — the guarded write MISSES and
        clobbers nothing.

        This structurally resolves the long-oscillating tension between "don't
        drop the freshly-rotated token" and "don't clobber a genuine peer
        rotation". The old exhaustion tail did an unconditional ``write(None)``
        after a final plaintext-confirming re-read, which left a TOCTOU gap: a
        peer rotation landing between that read and the unconditional write was
        clobbered with a token minted from the already-consumed material.
        Removing the unconditional write closes BOTH horns at once:

        * (A) don't drop the freshly rotated token — when the stored plaintext is
          confirmed to be the same token we consumed (only re-encrypted), we do
          NOT give up: we retry the ciphertext-guarded CAS against the freshly
          observed ciphertext so our new token still lands.
        * (B) don't clobber a peer rotation — because every write is guarded, a
          genuine rotation that lands in the former read->write gap now simply
          causes a MISS, and we re-read, see the different plaintext, and ADOPT
          it instead of overwriting.

        On a guarded-write miss we re-read and decrypt the stored plaintext to
        decide (never on the non-deterministic ciphertext):

        * genuinely DIFFERENT valid plaintext -> a peer rotated -> ADOPT it
          (return the peer row), never overwrite;
        * SAME plaintext as the token we exchanged FROM (re-encryption noise of
          the still-consumed token) -> retry the ciphertext-guarded CAS against
          the newly observed ciphertext so our rotation wins;
        * plaintext cannot be decrypted/compared -> raise the transient
          ``token_persist_conflict`` (we cannot prove a retry is safe).

        When the bounded guarded retries are exhausted OR the claim/caller
        deadline cuts the retry loop mid-storm, we do NOT drop the freshly rotated
        token: we run a DEDICATED small bounded retry loop
        (``_FINAL_PERSIST_MAX_ATTEMPTS`` attempts with tiny backoff) that is
        DELIBERATELY SEPARATE from the claim/caller deadline. Persisting a valid
        single-use rotated token is worth a few extra milliseconds over budget,
        because giving up here strands the account holding the already-consumed
        token. Each final attempt is still a ciphertext-guarded compare-and-set
        keyed on the freshly re-read ciphertext, so it is safe — it lands only if
        nothing changed since that read (persisting our new token and evicting the
        already-consumed one) and clobbers nothing otherwise. On each miss we
        re-read and decide on the DECRYPTED plaintext: a genuinely different peer
        plaintext is ADOPTED (never overwritten, done); the same plaintext merely
        re-encrypted is RETRIED against the newly observed ciphertext. Because any
        ciphertext change means a writer committed, and no realistic writer
        re-encrypts the same consumed token in a tight loop, this lands within a
        couple of attempts in practice.

        SAFE TERMINAL OUTCOME. Only if the dedicated final retries are ALL
        exhausted while the stored material stays the already-consumed token (a
        truly pathological same-plaintext storm, or undecryptable stored material
        — neither occurs in real production) do we give up — but we FAIL CLOSED
        rather than surfacing ordinary transient contention. A bare transient
        ``token_persist_conflict`` here would release the claim and let a later
        blind retry re-exchange the still-stored consumed token, turning this
        persistence race into an ``invalid_grant``/reauth PERMANENT knockout of a
        healthy account. Instead we flag the account ``REAUTH_REQUIRED`` through
        the SAME ciphertext-guarded status path (see
        ``_flag_persist_conflict_reauth``): the dead stored token is explicitly
        surfaced to operators, a peer rotation that lands in the guard window is
        ADOPTED (never clobbered), and the account is never left silently holding
        a consumed token that a blind retry would permanently knock out.

        This is what ends the long "drop the rotated token vs clobber a peer
        rotation" oscillation, and closes the irreducible trilemma corner
        (never-clobber vs never-drop vs bounded-time) that only appears in a
        same-plaintext storm where a writer re-encrypts the SAME consumed token
        faster than our CAS lands, repeatedly: the dedicated retries make the
        persist land in all realistic cases, and the safe terminal flag makes the
        pathological corner recoverable instead of a knockout. Every write remains
        a guarded compare-and-set, so nothing is ever clobbered.
