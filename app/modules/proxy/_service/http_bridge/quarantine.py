# Quarantine is a bounded, in-memory, session-scoped (never account-scoped)
# marker for HTTP bridge session keys that have proven silent/wedged: a later
# request must not re-attach to them and must take the existing fresh
# session/no-anchor path instead (#1534). It complements — and never replaces
# — the in-flight recovery machinery: the eventless watchdog and bounded
# replay (#1394) recover the request that is currently stuck, the fenced
# durable-anchor clear (#1563) stops a *fully eventless* full-resend anchor
# from being re-injected, and the durable retry circuit backs off in-place
# retries. Quarantine covers what those leave open: the reattached stream
# that delivers response events but never gets ``response.created`` (the
# ``response_event_count == 0`` gates in the stale/eventless detection never
# trip on it), and the repeated-wedge case where consecutive eventless
# timeouts keep rebuilding the same reattach.
