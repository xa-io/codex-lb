## Context

`scripts/check_proxy_architecture.py` and `scripts/check_cancellation_safety.py`
are the two existing proxy fitness gates. Both are stdlib-only AST scripts, run
by `make architecture-check`, and the first one loads its numeric ratchets from
a marked TOML block inside `openspec/specs/proxy-architecture/spec.md` so a
threshold move is a reviewable spec edit rather than a Python constant. The
timing-seam gate follows the same house style and reuses the same spec file
with a second, independently marked block, so the thresholds loader (which
requires exactly one of *its* marker pair and rejects unknown keys) is
untouched.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Fail `make lint` when a new raw timing, task-spawn or clock site lands in a
  proxy turn-lifecycle module, or when a caller of an owner-less seam function
  silently takes its real default.
- Keep every exemption reviewable in one place and make headroom impossible to
  accrue silently.
- Let a reviewer distinguish a missed injection from an accepted residual
  (`--explain`) and regenerate the table mechanically (`--report`).

**Non-Goals:**

- Proving that the injected sites are *used* correctly (that is the harness's
  property test and the real-parity tests in PR A).
- Scanning `app/core/clients/proxy.py`, `app/core/utils/sse.py` or other
  modules outside the proxy package; `app/core/clock.py` is the one permitted
  raw adapter and is excluded by construction.
- Detecting timing primitives reached through arbitrary objects (`self._loop`,
  a loop passed as a parameter). Only loops obtained from
  `asyncio.get_running_loop()`/`get_event_loop()` in the same scope resolve.

## Decisions

### Scan every proxy module with per-module allowances, not a module list

An allowlist of scanned modules would let a new lifecycle module opt out by
omission. Scanning every `*.py` under `app/modules/proxy/` (plus
`shared_future.py`, whose `ensure_future` fallback and timed
`wait_on_shared_future` are turn-path seams) with unlisted modules at zero
means a raw site anywhere in the package fails unless the spec block is
edited in the same diff. A listed module that no longer exists is a
configuration failure so the gate cannot pass silently after a rename.

### Exact-count pin in the test, `<=` in the script

The script keeps the ratchet semantics of the other gates (a count below its
allowance passes). `test_repository_allowances_are_exact` additionally asserts
`count == allowance` for every listed module and that no unlisted module has
a count, so removing a raw site must lower the number in the same diff and a
stale allowance cannot hide a later regression under accrued headroom.
`test_repository_report_reproduces_committed_block` pins that `--report`
regenerates the committed block byte-for-value.

### `missing-scheduler-kwarg` closes the hidden-default hole

Every owner-less seam function keeps a real default so partial test doubles
work, which means a new caller can silently take the wall clock. The rule
matches the callee by its terminal attribute name (`_facade()._x(...)`,
`self._x(...)` and bare `_x(...)` all resolve) and requires each configured
keyword; the value is a string or a list so functions that take both
`scheduler` and `clock` require both. Passing an explicit
`REAL_SCHEDULER`/`REAL_CLOCK` is allowed because it is visible and greppable.
A `**kwargs` splat is taken as satisfying the requirement because the
keywords cannot be inspected statically. The `api.py` route layer's nineteen
calls to the deferring-cancellation helpers are carried as its
`missing-scheduler-kwarg` allowance rather than exempted by rule, so the owner
can make them explicit and lower the number later.

Functions whose name is shared with an unrelated method (`stream_responses`
exists on both the HTTP bridge owner client and `ProxyService`;
`_select_with_stickiness` is both a module function and a `LoadBalancer`
method) are deliberately not listed: terminal-name matching would flag the
homonym.

### Timing allowances are per rule

A single per-module total for the four timing rules would let a module trade
one accepted residual for a new bypass of another kind (drop one
`missing-scheduler-kwarg` site, add one raw `asyncio.sleep`) without moving
the number, and the exact-count pin would not notice either. `[allowances.timing]`
therefore holds one inline table of per-rule counts per module
(`{ raw-timeout = 2, raw-task-spawn = 3 }`); unlisted rules are zero, a table
naming a rule outside the category is a definition failure, and
`test_main_rejects_trading_one_timing_rule_for_another_under_a_per_rule_allowance`
pins the substitution. A plain integer is still accepted as a category total
so an older block keeps loading, but `--report` always renders per-rule counts
and `test_repository_allowances_are_exact` asserts the committed table is
per-rule, so the compatibility form cannot become the committed form.

### `raw-clock-read` is a separate allowance table

Clock reads are the highest-volume, most-likely-to-rot rule and the one the
owner may want to strike or defer independently; a separate table lets that
happen in one edit without touching the timing rows. It has a single rule, so
its plain integers are already per-rule counts. The rule counts the
`time.time() if now is None else now` and `REAL_CLOCK.x()` default idioms on
purpose so a new hidden wall-clock default shows up as a raised number.

### Alias discovery is file-wide and canonical names are always recognised

The primitive sets also cover the less common spellings a bypass could reach
for: the blocking `time.sleep`, `anyio.sleep_forever`/`sleep_until`, the
absolute-deadline `anyio.fail_at`/`move_on_at` and `anyio.create_task_group`.
None occur in the scanned tree today, so they add coverage without allowances.

`check_cancellation_safety.py` restricts alias discovery to module-level
imports so an unrelated nested import cannot redefine an alias for the whole
file. For a rot guard the failure modes are asymmetric: a false positive is
visible and fixable by renaming, an evasion through a function-local
`import asyncio as aio` is silent. This gate therefore collects aliases from
every import in the file and always recognises the canonical
`asyncio`/`anyio`/`time` names; a function parameter that shadows a recognised
name still suppresses the match, as in the other gate.

### Configuration failures do not hide parse failures

As with the thresholds block, an invalid definition (missing or duplicate
marker, wrong fence, malformed TOML, unknown key or table, non-positive or
non-integer allowance, malformed keyword list) is reported by name. Module
parse failures are still reported alongside it; allowance comparisons are not,
because they cannot be evaluated without a valid definition.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Rename churn: a module rename must update the block in the same diff. This
  is intended (the gate refuses to pass silently when its target disappears).
- Terminal-name matching for `missing-scheduler-kwarg` can flag an unrelated
  method with the same name; the table is explicit and small, and the two
  known homonyms are excluded.
- The CI `changes` filter runs `make lint` for `app/**`, `scripts/**`,
  `tests/**` and `Makefile`; an edit that touches only the spec block is
  validated on the next backend change. This matches the thresholds block.

## Open Questions

- Whether the `api.py` route-layer calls should pass `REAL_SCHEDULER`
  explicitly (allowance 19 -> 0) or stay as allowance.
- Whether the compact endpoint, realtime relay, request-log drain, event
  batcher and upstream client residuals get their own injection follow-ups or
  remain accepted allowances.
