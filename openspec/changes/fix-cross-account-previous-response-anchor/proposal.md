# Fix cross-account compact previous_response_id anchor wedge

## Why

The HTTP-bridge "compact anchor" continuity optimization injects
`previous_response_id = session.last_completed_response_id` and trims the
already-stored history prefix so a follow-up turn only carries the new items.

A `previous_response_id` is **account-scoped** on the upstream Responses API:
only the account that created the response can resume it. The injection had no
account-ownership check. When a Codex session fails over to a different account
(e.g. the durable owner account became unavailable, or a durable session record
is restored onto a new session bound to another account), the anchor points at a
response the serving account never created. Upstream then accepts the WebSocket
`response.create` but **never emits `response.created`**, and because the history
was trimmed away there is no fallback. The per-bridge `response_create_gate`
(a `Semaphore(1)`) stays held: the holder's own client eventually reports
`stream disconnected before completion: idle timeout waiting for SSE`, and later
requests on the same session time out as `codex-lb is temporarily overloaded
during http_bridge_response_create_gate`.

Observed live on 2026-07-10: sol sessions that fanned across three accounts
repeatedly wedged on the same anchor (`resp_0bc0310d…`) even though the accounts
had quota. Freeing the gate (the stuck-gate retire backstop) does not stop the
recurrence because the session re-injects the same cross-account anchor.

## What Changes

- Track the account that owns `last_completed_response_id` on the bridge session
  (`last_completed_response_account_id`), set in lockstep at every setter: the
  real upstream `response.completed` path records the session's current account;
  the durable-restore path records the durable owner account.
- The session-level compact-anchor injection MUST only fire when the anchor's
  owning account equals the session's serving account. Otherwise the request
  falls through to a full-history resend (correct output, slightly more tokens),
  never a cross-account `previous_response_id`.
- The owner-forward recovery anchor injection gets the same guard. That rebind
  runs with `allow_previous_response_recovery_rebind` /
  `allow_bootstrap_owner_rebind`, which are explicitly allowed to bind the
  session to an account other than the durable owner, so it is the second site
  where a proxy-injected anchor can cross an account boundary.
- Both declines emit a `cross_account_anchor_declined` bridge event naming the
  injection site and the anchor's owning account, so the wedge family stays
  observable from bridge event logs.

The remaining proxy-side injection site, the pre-binding durable "fresh reattach"
anchor, is already covered: setting `previous_response_id` there makes the durable
owner a *required* account (`require_preferred_account`), so session creation and
session reuse both refuse to serve that request on another account, and an
unavailable owner degrades along the account-neutral full-resend path instead.

## Impact

- Affected specs: `sticky-session-operations`
- Affected code: `_service/support.py` (`_HTTPBridgeSession`),
  `_service/http_bridge/streaming.py` (both injection guards + durable-restore
  owner), `_service/http_bridge/upstream_events.py` (completion owner),
  `_service/http_bridge/mixin.py` (clear the owner with the anchor on an
  account-changing reconnect).
- Behavior: on cross-account failover, continuity is preserved by resending full
  history instead of an unresolvable anchor. No client-visible protocol change.
- Follow-ups (tracked separately, not in this change): the WebSocket-transport
  anchor path (`websocket_session_anchor_injected`), and a proactive
  `response.created` watchdog that replays the stored full-history payload if any
  anchored request stalls.
