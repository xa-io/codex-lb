# Tasks

## 1. Clock and scheduler seams

- [x] 1.1 Add narrow clock and scheduler adapters with real production defaults.
- [x] 1.2 Thread the clock through the proxy service, load balancer, and HTTP
      bridge retry circuit seams needed by the first harness.
- [x] 1.3 Thread scheduler waits through the selected admission, startup probe,
      HTTP bridge, and WebSocket lifecycle seams.
- [x] 1.4 Thread scheduler task creation through the HTTP bridge and WebSocket
      lifecycle owners so a simulation owns every task a turn spawns.
- [x] 1.5 Declare the clock and scheduler collaborators on the HTTP bridge and
      WebSocket service protocols.
- [x] 1.6 Read the collaborators through `scheduler_for`/`clock_for` inside the
      mixins so partial service objects keep the real production default.
- [x] 1.7 Add `Scheduler.wait` and `Scheduler.fail_after` so timed multi-future
      waits and the anyio selection budget stay verbatim instead of being
      rewritten around `wait_for`.
- [x] 1.8 Re-plumb the raw timing/task sites main added after the fork
      (#1891/#1902/#1958/#1977/#1986 spawns and waits across http_bridge,
      websocket, streaming, api_key_usage, request_log) through the seam.
- [x] 1.9 Route every turn-path budget read (bridge admission, bridge/websocket/
      streaming retry budgets, websocket receive and connect deadlines) through
      the owner's injected clock so no virtual deadline is compared against the
      wall clock.
- [x] 1.10 Make the real scheduler's timing methods return the `asyncio`
      coroutine itself (no wrapper frame per relayed event) and resolve the
      collaborators once per bridge session / websocket connection instead of
      per event.
- [x] 1.11 Route the remaining turn-path spawn channels through the scheduler:
      the reconnect abort `shield(<coroutine>)` sites, the grouped-terminal
      persistence `gather`, and the deferring-cancellation helpers behind
      `_release_websocket_response_create_gate`.

## 2. Deterministic tests

- [x] 2.1 Add a virtual-clock scheduler harness under `tests/simulation/`.
- [x] 2.2 Convert selected admission and startup probe tests from real sleeps
      to virtual time.
- [x] 2.3 Convert the HTTP bridge cancel-drain idle-timeout and recovery-wait
      tests to virtual time.
- [x] 2.4 Add a seeded schedule-exploring bridge lifecycle property test that
      dispatches events as concurrent scheduler tasks.
- [x] 2.5 Add a canary proving the property checker catches a planted
      double-release bug.
- [x] 2.6 Add virtual_time regressions: non-positive `wait_for` timeouts raise
      like asyncio, `advance` moves chronologically so sequential sleeps
      complete, `wait` reports deadline-tick completions as done,
      `fail_after` raises `TimeoutError` and re-raises a racing external
      cancellation.
- [x] 2.7 Give the virtual `wait_for` and `fail_after` the shape of the real
      primitives: inline await under an `asyncio.timeout`-style deadline
      (same task, contextvars, anyio shields cut through) and a real
      `anyio.CancelScope` cancelled by the virtual timer (shields respected,
      re-delivery per checkpoint).
- [x] 2.8 Drive the production terminal handler, detach backstop and
      pre-created retry in the property turn, deliver a real task
      cancellation after the production claim, attribute each reservation
      settlement to the production path that performed it, and assert
      quiescence of every owned task.
- [x] 2.9 Add the abandoned-shield oracle to the virtual scheduler and the
      production-shaped canaries (double release on detach, lost abort
      settlement, dropped reservation release, retry reacquisition,
      re-shielded lease release) plus a coverage test over the settlement
      paths and the injected cancellation.
- [x] 2.10 Model the reservation boundary like production: per-reservation-id
      compare-and-set (effective vs redundant writes), detached finalizer
      settlement write, modelled health write; check the invariant under
      several write-latency profiles and pin the redundant-release
      observation as a strict known failure.
- [x] 2.11 Land the settlement cancel at seeded virtual offsets (inside the
      lease release, inside the reservation write, after the settlement
      transfer), classify each landing from product state, assert the
      abort path never writes a finalizer-settled reservation, and prove the
      landing coverage.
- [x] 2.12 Gate the abandoned-shield oracle's count assertions on CPython 3.14
      (the residue does not exist on CI's 3.13) and document the blind spot.
- [x] 2.13 Pin the anyio 4.13 `Lock` wedge: minimal reproduction and the
      affected production-turn seeds as strict expected failures conditioned
      on the anyio version.

## 3. Verification

- [x] 3.1 Run the new and converted deterministic tests three consecutive times.
- [x] 3.2 Run strict OpenSpec validation.
- [x] 3.3 Run the full pytest suite and confirm no new failures beyond the
      documented baseline.
- [x] 3.4 Run `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, the proxy architecture
      ratchet, and `ty check`.
- [x] 3.5 Collect `tests/simulation` in `make test-unit` so CI runs the
      harness.
- [x] 3.6 Compare each real adapter against the `asyncio`/`anyio` primitive it
      wraps (`tests/unit/test_clock_real_parity.py`).
- [x] 3.7 Run production mutants against the property test (dropped terminal
      claim, abort path skipping settlement, double admission release,
      cancel-unsafe lease release, re-introduced shield leak all caught;
      the surviving retry-ownership and non-bridge-path mutants are explained
      in the change context).
- [x] 3.8 Re-run the mutants and a 3000-seed sweep under the compare-and-set
      model and every latency profile; record which post-settlement guard
      mutants the `abort_after_transfer` invariant catches.
