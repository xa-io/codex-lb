## 1. Public stream normalization

- [x] 1.1 Track the next numeric sequence across public Responses SSE events.
- [x] 1.2 Sequence terminal `response.failed` events that omit a valid number.
- [x] 1.3 Preserve valid upstream sequences and backend Codex stream shapes.

## 2. Validation

- [x] 2.1 Add focused public normalizer sequence regressions, including unique
      synthesized created/failure sequences.
- [x] 2.2 Cover bridge failure after reasoning on fresh and reused sessions.
- [x] 2.3 Verify compatibility with OpenCode's pinned OpenAI AI SDK parser.
- [x] 2.4 Run focused tests, lint, type checking, bridge checks, and OpenSpec validation.
