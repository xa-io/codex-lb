## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Public synthetic Responses failures carry numeric sequences

Public streaming `POST /v1/responses` MUST emit every terminal
`response.failed` with a finite integer `sequence_number` so
strict OpenAI SDK Responses parsers recognize the terminal failure. If the
upstream or proxy-generated event omits a finite integer sequence, the public
normalizer MUST assign the next sequence after all finite integer sequences it
has observed in the same downstream stream. If it also synthesizes a leading
`response.created` from that failure, the created event MUST consume the next
sequence and the failure MUST use the following sequence so both events have
distinct values. Otherwise, if no finite integer sequence has been observed,
failure numbering MUST begin at zero.

The public normalizer MUST preserve an existing finite integer
`sequence_number` and advance its next-sequence watermark accordingly. This
repair MUST NOT change Codex-private backend stream shapes.

#### Scenario: Bridge failure after reasoning remains parseable

- **GIVEN** public `/v1/responses` has emitted sequenced reasoning events
- **WHEN** the upstream bridge closes before a terminal response
- **THEN** the downstream terminal `response.failed` carries the next numeric
  `sequence_number`
- **AND** a strict OpenAI SDK parser recognizes it as a terminal failure

#### Scenario: Leading failure follows synthesized created sequence

- **GIVEN** public `/v1/responses` has not emitted a finite integer sequence
- **WHEN** an unsequenced leading `response.failed` requires a synthesized
  `response.created`
- **THEN** the created event carries `sequence_number = 0`
- **AND** the terminal failure carries `sequence_number = 1`

#### Scenario: Failure after an unsequenced created event starts at zero

- **GIVEN** public `/v1/responses` has emitted an unsequenced
  `response.created` and no finite integer sequence
- **WHEN** the proxy synthesizes a terminal `response.failed`
- **THEN** the terminal event carries `sequence_number = 0`

#### Scenario: Valid upstream failure sequence remains unchanged

- **GIVEN** an upstream terminal `response.failed` carries a finite integer
  `sequence_number`
- **WHEN** the public normalizer forwards the event
- **THEN** it preserves that sequence number unchanged
- **AND** if it must synthesize a leading `response.created`, that event uses
  the immediately preceding integer sequence

#### Scenario: Backend Codex stream shape remains unchanged

- **GIVEN** a Codex-private backend Responses stream carries an unsequenced
  terminal failure
- **WHEN** the stream is served without the public OpenAI SDK contract
- **THEN** the proxy does not add a public compatibility sequence
