# Tasks

- [x] Add sanitized pre-dispatch provenance to account-routed transport errors.
- [x] Permit same-pool fallback for non-idempotent requests only when dispatch is proven impossible.
- [x] Add movable-account failover for raw HTTP/SSE and HTTP bridge startup.
- [x] Preserve native WebSocket failover while applying the same confirmed-route backoff.
- [x] Preserve hard continuity/file pins and the original failure when no replacement exists.
- [x] Defer dead-route account-health writes until request-scoped API-key settlement.
- [x] Track HTTP-bridge settlement ownership per reservation generation and fail closed on unconfirmed release.
- [x] Add core-client, load-balancer, HTTP/SSE, native WebSocket, and HTTP-bridge regressions.
- [x] Run focused tests, static checks, strict OpenSpec validation, and the relevant broader suites.
