## Verification Report

### Backend follow-up

- RED: `uv run pytest tests/integration/test_conversations_api.py -k 'non_sql_whitespace'`
  failed before the fix because the NBSP-wrapped identity was persisted as
  `nbsp-conversation`.
- GREEN: `uv run pytest tests/integration/test_conversations_api.py -k 'non_sql_whitespace or details_exact_rows_elapsed_order_and_404 or list_excludes_blank'`
  passed: `3 passed, 17 deselected`.
- Feature suite: `uv run pytest tests/integration/test_conversations_api.py tests/integration/test_request_logs_filters.py tests/unit/test_request_logs_service.py`
  passed: `43 passed`.
- `uv run ty check`: passed (`All checks passed!`).
- `uv run ruff check && uv run ruff format --check`: passed (`836 files already formatted`).

### Frontend follow-up

- RED: `bun x vitest run src/features/dashboard/components/dashboard-page.test.tsx -t 'single conversation observer'`
  failed before the fix because `ConversationsView` received no shared state.
- GREEN: `bun x vitest run src/features/dashboard/components/dashboard-page.test.tsx src/features/dashboard/components/conversations-view.test.tsx -t 'single conversation observer|ConversationsView'`
  passed: `2 files, 4 tests`.
- Dashboard/integration suite: `bun x vitest run src/features/dashboard src/__integration__/dashboard-flow.test.tsx`
  passed: `22 files, 255 tests`.
- `bun x tsc -b`: passed.
- `bun run lint`: passed.
- `bun x vite build`: passed.
- `bun run doctor`: completed with non-blocking repository-wide diagnostics
  (`65 issues`, including an unrelated `src/components/copy-button.tsx`
  state-updater warning); no doctor finding targets the changed conversation
  files.

### Shared validation

- `openspec validate --specs`: passed (`47 passed, 0 failed`).
- `openspec validate add-conversation-dashboard --type change --strict`:
  passed (`Change 'add-conversation-dashboard' is valid`).
- `git diff --check`: passed.

### UI refinement final follow-up

- Integration regression update: `frontend/src/__integration__/dashboard-flow.test.tsx`
  now seeds `conversationSearch=opencode`, `conversationLimit=15`, and
  `conversationOffset=7`, asserts the removed Conversations searchbox is absent,
  and verifies both conversation and request-log URL state survive view switches.
- Privacy RED: `cd frontend && bun run test --
  src/features/dashboard/components/conversation-table.test.tsx` failed with
  `1 failed | 6 passed (7)` because the email fallback lacked `privacy-blur`.
- Privacy GREEN: the same command passed with `7 passed (7)` after applying the
  established `usePrivacyStore`/`isEmailLabel`/account-ID tracking pattern;
  display-name and unknown-ID fallbacks remain unblurred. Tests reset privacy
  state before each case.
- Header RED/GREEN: the selector test first failed with `1 failed | 6 passed
  (7)` when it asserted the trigger's classes; after moving the complete title
  classes onto the actual trigger, it passed `7 passed (7)`.
- Integration: `cd frontend && bun x vitest run
  src/__integration__/dashboard-flow.test.tsx` passed.
- Full dashboard suite: `cd frontend && bun x vitest run src/features/dashboard
  src/__integration__/dashboard-flow.test.tsx` passed.
- Focused refinement suite: the five dashboard files passed `42/42` tests.
- Visual validation passed at `1440x900` and `390x844`, including the uppercase
  selector, absent conversation filter, reordered/two-line Last request,
  display-name/email/ID account fallbacks, and copy-free details dialog. The
  four after-state PNGs were stored outside the repository at:
  `/var/folders/f_/2dskvbc54gvfr8smd02zz6hr0000gn/T/opencode/conversation-dashboard-evidence/`.
- Base-commit before-state captures were generated outside the repository from
  commit `3406c0a100e86b574439b1ca3256d71e74d518da` under the same evidence
  directory; no git worktree, HEAD, or index was mutated.
- `cd frontend && bun run typecheck`: passed.
- `cd frontend && bun run lint`: passed.
- `openspec validate add-conversation-dashboard --type change --strict`:
  passed.
- `openspec validate --specs`: passed (`47 passed, 0 failed`).
- `git diff --check`: passed.

### Rolling timeframe review follow-up

- `cd frontend && bun x vitest run src/features/dashboard/hooks/use-conversations.test.ts`:
  passed (`11 tests`), including regressions proving refetches send the same
  symbolic `timeframe` and no browser-generated `since`.
- `cd frontend && bun x vitest run src/features/dashboard src/__integration__/dashboard-flow.test.tsx`:
  passed (`23 files, 268 tests`).
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/integration/test_conversations_api.py
  tests/integration/test_request_logs_filters.py
  tests/unit/test_request_logs_service.py`: passed (`48 tests`).
- `cd frontend && bun run typecheck && bun run lint`: passed.
- `openspec validate --specs`, strict change validation, and `git diff --check`:
  passed.
