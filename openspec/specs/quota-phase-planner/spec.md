# quota-phase-planner Specification

## Purpose

Define the quota phase planner contracts for audit-only defaults,
phase-aware routing costs, scheduler safety, warmup-effect evidence, and
dashboard/operator controls.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Quota phase planner defaults are non-invasive

The quota phase planner SHALL default to audit-only behavior. Fresh installations
MUST enable routing costs and scheduler audit rows without sending synthetic
traffic, and the planner MUST skip work instead of blocking user traffic when
forecast, usage, or warmup-effect data is stale, missing, or uncertain.

#### Scenario: Fresh installs do not send warmup traffic

- **GIVEN** the service starts with default quota planner settings
- **WHEN** the scheduler evaluates a planner tick
- **THEN** it may write shadow or no-op decision rows
- **AND** it MUST NOT send synthetic warmup traffic

#### Scenario: Uncertain planner data is non-blocking

- **GIVEN** planner input data is stale, missing, or uncertain
- **WHEN** routing or scheduler planning evaluates accounts
- **THEN** real user requests remain eligible according to the normal hard
  account gates
- **AND** scheduler actions are skipped or recorded as audit decisions instead
  of burning quota

### Requirement: Quota phase scheduler uses one async session safely

The quota phase planner scheduler SHALL avoid concurrent database operations on
the same async session. When the scheduler needs primary and secondary usage
snapshots from one session, it MUST issue those repository reads sequentially or
use separate sessions for true parallelism.

#### Scenario: Primary and secondary usage snapshots are read safely

- **GIVEN** a quota planner tick is running inside one background database
  session
- **WHEN** it loads primary and secondary usage snapshots
- **THEN** it reads the snapshots without overlapping operations on that session
- **AND** the tick can continue to build account state, forecasts, simulations,
  and decisions

### Requirement: Warmup effects require usage evidence

The quota phase planner SHALL only record a warmup effect as observed when a
post-probe usage row is available. Missing post-probe usage evidence MUST NOT
produce an `observed`, `known`, or `high` confidence warmup-effect observation.

#### Scenario: Missing post-probe usage does not unlock automation

- **GIVEN** a warmup probe completes
- **AND** usage refresh does not return a post-probe usage row for the account
- **WHEN** the warmup effect observation is recorded
- **THEN** the observation confidence is stored as `unknown`
- **AND** later automatic synthetic warmup gates do not treat that observation
  as sufficient warmup-effect evidence

### Requirement: Quota planner API and dashboard expose auditable controls

The quota planner SHALL expose authenticated dashboard APIs and UI controls for
settings, forecast, decisions, warm-now, and cancellation. Settings changes and
scheduler decisions MUST remain auditable, and decision responses SHOULD expose
parsed decision details when stored audit JSON is available. Warm-now reset
eligibility gates MUST compare persisted quota reset epochs against the current
UTC instant regardless of the server process timezone.

#### Scenario: Operators can inspect planner decisions

- **WHEN** a dashboard user requests quota planner decisions
- **THEN** the API returns recent decisions with status, action, account,
  scheduled time, reason, and parsed details when present

#### Scenario: Warm-now uses server-side gates

- **WHEN** a dashboard user requests a manual warm-now probe
- **THEN** the server evaluates the same safety gates used by scheduler
  execution
- **AND** it records a skipped, failed, or executed decision outcome

#### Scenario: Warm-now reset gate is timezone-independent

- **GIVEN** a short-window usage reset epoch is already due in UTC
- **AND** the server process local timezone is UTC+
- **WHEN** a dashboard user requests a manual warm-now probe for that account
- **THEN** the reset gate MUST NOT skip with `account_window_already_active`
  because of process-local timestamp conversion
- **AND** the warm-now request remains eligible for execution when the other
  server-side gates allow it

### Requirement: Quota planner decisions persist naive UTC instants

The quota phase planner SHALL normalize timezone-aware datetimes to naive UTC
before persisting them to the timezone-naive `QuotaPlannerDecision.scheduled_at`
and `executed_at` columns. When a planned or executed instant is timezone-aware,
the persisted column value MUST equal that instant converted to UTC with its
`tzinfo` removed, preserving the absolute instant. Naive datetimes MUST be
persisted unchanged. JSON audit snapshots MAY continue to record the same
instants as ISO-8601 strings that include a timezone offset.

#### Scenario: Aware planned instant is stored as naive UTC

- **GIVEN** the scheduler logs a decision with a timezone-aware UTC
  `scheduled_at`
- **WHEN** the repository persists the decision row
- **THEN** the stored `scheduled_at` is timezone-naive
- **AND** it equals the original instant expressed in UTC

#### Scenario: Aware executed instant is stored as naive UTC on update

- **GIVEN** a decision is updated with a timezone-aware UTC `executed_at`
- **WHEN** the repository writes the status update
- **THEN** the stored `executed_at` is timezone-naive
- **AND** it equals the original instant expressed in UTC

#### Scenario: Naive instants persist unchanged

- **GIVEN** a decision is logged or updated with a timezone-naive datetime
- **WHEN** the repository persists the value
- **THEN** the stored value is unchanged and remains timezone-naive

### Requirement: Planner repository datetime boundaries are UTC-normalized

Quota phase planner repository methods MUST normalize timezone-aware datetime
inputs to naive UTC before binding those values into database comparisons or
persisted planner observation timestamps.

#### Scenario: Aware datetimes are accepted at repository boundaries

- **GIVEN** quota planner repository calls receive timezone-aware datetime
  values for warmup decision queries, demand aggregation, or quota window
  observations
- **WHEN** those calls bind the values into database statements
- **THEN** the bound values use naive UTC timestamps
- **AND** the queries return rows that match the equivalent UTC instant

### Requirement: Warmup decisions are claimed before synthetic traffic

Warmup execution SHALL atomically transition a planned decision to `executing`
before reserving API-key budget or sending synthetic probe traffic, and that
transition SHALL be the single authoritative enforcement point for the daily
warmup count and credit budgets: the claim statement MUST evaluate either the
`planned` precondition or an expired `executing` warmup claim plus both budget
guards atomically, so concurrent claimants on other replicas or processes
cannot exceed either budget. The count-budget guard MUST include in-flight
`executing` warmup decisions in addition to `executed` ones, so a probe
reserves budget when it is claimed rather than after it completes. The claim
MUST record its own timestamp on the decision, and in-flight `executing`
decisions MUST count against the budget day in which they were claimed — not
the day the decision row was created — so a decision planned before the daily
boundary but claimed after it consumes the claim day's budget. The claim lease
TTL MUST be at least the configured Responses stream request budget so a
healthy warmup probe cannot lose its claim mid-flight. On PostgreSQL,
concurrent claims MUST be serialized (a transaction-scoped advisory lock on a
fixed warmup-budget key) so two claims cannot both evaluate the budget against
a stale snapshot; on SQLite the claim MUST execute as a single statement under
the database-level writer lock. When a claim is refused because a budget guard
failed, the decision MUST be skipped with a reason that distinguishes the
exhausted count budget from the exhausted credit budget. Final outcomes such as
`executed`, `failed`, or API-key skip reasons MUST only update decisions that
are still `executing`. Cancellation MUST only update decisions that are still
`planned` or `skipped` and MUST NOT cancel an in-flight `executing` decision.
Every warmup decision MUST reuse one deterministic warmup request identity
across retries so a reclaimed claim can reconcile from an already-committed
request log instead of sending a duplicate probe.

#### Scenario: Planned warmup is claimed before probe send

- **GIVEN** a planned warmup decision is eligible to run
- **WHEN** warm-now starts sending the synthetic probe
- **THEN** the persisted decision status is already `executing`
- **AND** a concurrent worker cannot claim the same planned decision

#### Scenario: Concurrent claims cannot exceed the daily count budget

- **GIVEN** two replicas each hold a planned warmup decision
- **AND** one warmup remains in the daily count budget
- **WHEN** both replicas execute warm-now concurrently
- **THEN** exactly one decision transitions to `executing` and sends a probe
- **AND** the other decision is skipped with reason
  `daily_warmup_count_budget_exhausted`

#### Scenario: In-flight executing warmups reserve count budget

- **GIVEN** a warmup decision claimed today is still `executing`
- **AND** the daily count budget allows one warmup
- **WHEN** another replica attempts to claim a planned warmup decision
- **THEN** the claim is refused
- **AND** the planned decision does not transition to `executing`

#### Scenario: Warmup planned yesterday but claimed today consumes today's budget

- **GIVEN** a warmup decision the scheduler persisted before the daily boundary
  with a future `scheduled_at`
- **AND** the daily count budget allows one warmup
- **WHEN** the decision is claimed after the daily boundary
- **THEN** the claimed `executing` decision counts against the new day's budget
- **AND** a subsequent claim of another planned decision on the same day is
  refused

#### Scenario: Claim is refused when the credit budget is spent

- **GIVEN** warmup request logs recorded today already meet the daily credit
  budget
- **WHEN** a planned warmup decision is claimed after its execution gate read
  stale budget state
- **THEN** the claim is refused before any probe is sent
- **AND** the decision is skipped with reason
  `daily_warmup_credit_budget_exhausted`

#### Scenario: Warmup claim lease covers the probe budget

- **GIVEN** the configured Responses stream request budget exceeds five minutes
- **WHEN** warm-now claims a warmup decision
- **THEN** the persisted `lease_expires_at` is at least one full stream budget
  after the claim timestamp

#### Scenario: Reclaimed decision settles from a committed success log

- **GIVEN** a warmup decision's prior attempt already committed a successful
  warmup request log
- **AND** the process died before the final decision-status update committed
- **WHEN** a later replica reclaims the expired `executing` decision
- **THEN** it marks the decision `executed` from the durable request-log
  evidence
- **AND** it MUST NOT send a second synthetic probe

#### Scenario: Executing warmup cannot be canceled

- **GIVEN** a warmup decision is already `executing`
- **WHEN** an operator requests cancellation
- **THEN** the decision remains `executing`
- **AND** the response reports that the decision is not cancelable

### Requirement: Scheduler reconciles expired warmup claims independently of current actions

The quota planner scheduler SHALL reconcile expired `executing` warmup claims
even when the current planner output contains no matching warmup action. This
reconciliation sweep MUST run before the scheduler decides that a tick is a
pure no-op, and it MUST reuse the same warm-now recovery contract so manual
warm-now decisions and no-longer-planned scheduled decisions can self-heal.

#### Scenario: Expired manual warmup claim is reconciled without a new planner action

- **GIVEN** an expired `executing` warmup decision created by a manual warm-now
- **AND** the current planner output contains no action for that decision
- **WHEN** the scheduler runs its next leader tick
- **THEN** the expired claim is still reconciled
- **AND** the decision no longer remains stuck in `executing`

### Requirement: Phase planning is scoped to short rolling windows

An account SHALL be phase-plannable for scheduler warmup candidacy and cold-start routing costs only when its selection state carries a primary window sample with duration metadata of at most 24 hours (weekly and monthly windows are not phase-plannable; samples without duration metadata are not phase-plannable). The warm-up execution gate and warmup-effect observed confidence SHALL treat positive evidence of a long window in the primary slot as disqualifying, while absent samples or samples without duration metadata keep legacy bootstrap behavior. Active/cold window state SHALL derive from the primary window sample's reset timestamp, not from blocked-status reset markers, and only phase-plannable accounts SHALL count as having active phase windows — a long unremapped primary sample MUST NOT feed expiring-window bonuses, active-reset stagger anchors, or simulated pool capacity.

#### Scenario: Weekly-only account is not planned

- **GIVEN** an account whose usage reports only a weekly window
- **WHEN** the planner evaluates warmup candidates and routing costs
- **THEN** the account receives no warmup actions and no cold-start costs

#### Scenario: Mixed pool plans only short-window accounts

- **GIVEN** one account with a 300-minute primary window sample and one account with only weekly usage
- **WHEN** the planner plans warmups during the prewarm band
- **THEN** only the short-window account is considered

#### Scenario: Healthy active window is not treated as cold

- **GIVEN** a healthy `active` account whose primary window sample has an unexpired reset timestamp
- **WHEN** the planner builds routing costs
- **THEN** the account is treated as having an active window
- **AND** it receives no cold-start cost

#### Scenario: Execution gate refuses accounts with a long-window primary sample

- **WHEN** a warm-now request targets an account whose latest primary-slot sample reports a weekly or monthly window duration
- **THEN** the execution gate refuses with a stable `no_short_window` reason

#### Scenario: Execution gate refuses superseded short-window samples

- **GIVEN** an account whose latest primary-slot sample reports a short window
- **AND** a strictly newer long-window row proves a later refresh no longer reported the short window
- **WHEN** a warm-now request targets that account
- **THEN** the execution gate refuses with `no_short_window`

#### Scenario: Superseded short-window samples lose plannability

- **GIVEN** an account whose primary sample is strictly older than its long-window row
- **WHEN** selection state is built
- **THEN** the derived short-window duration is cleared whether or not the stale sample's reset has elapsed
- **AND** the planner does not treat the account as having a short phase window

### Requirement: Phase math derives from observed window durations

Candidate warmup start times, planned window resets, pool-simulation window spans, and synchronization penalties SHALL use each account's observed primary window duration. Planner actions SHALL carry the window duration they were planned with, and cross-account reset math SHALL use each action's own duration.

#### Scenario: Peak alignment uses the observed duration

- **GIVEN** an account whose primary window sample reports a 60-minute duration
- **WHEN** the planner derives candidate start times for a forecast peak
- **THEN** peak-aligned candidates subtract 60 minutes rather than 5 hours
- **AND** the planned action records a 60-minute window duration

### Requirement: Concurrent decision logging converges on idempotency keys

The planner decision log SHALL treat `idempotency_key` as a convergence point:
when multiple writers concurrently record a decision with the same idempotency
key, exactly one decision row SHALL persist and every writer MUST receive that
surviving row. A duplicate-key collision MUST NOT surface as an unhandled
integrity error that aborts the remainder of a planning tick.

#### Scenario: Two replicas log the same decision key concurrently

- **GIVEN** two planner replicas derive the same decision idempotency key
- **WHEN** both log the decision concurrently against one database
- **THEN** exactly one decision row persists for that key
- **AND** both replicas receive the surviving decision without raising

#### Scenario: Duplicate keys do not abort the planning tick

- **GIVEN** a planning tick logs decisions for several due accounts
- **WHEN** one decision's idempotency key was concurrently inserted by another
  writer
- **THEN** the tick continues logging the remaining accounts' decisions
