# Deployment & Installation Context

## Purpose and Scope

This capability owns the install contracts (Helm modes, Compose profiles,
smoke tests) and the operator environment-variable contract at
settings-load time: which `CODEX_LB_*` values exist, which are deliberately
fixed, and how removed settings are retired.

See `openspec/specs/deployment-installation/spec.md` for normative
requirements.

## Timeout Invariant Linter Scope

The timeout invariant linter is a startup `Settings` guardrail. Strict mode is
an opt-in startup or CI failure path for violating startup configuration, not a
general runtime timeout validator.

Validated inputs:

- The `Settings` object materialized at startup.
- Explicitly imported code constants used by the two constant-backed rules:
  model-registry refresh cadence and durable HTTP bridge retry-circuit TTL.

Known non-goals and follow-ups:

- Per-request `ContextVar` overrides are not revalidated. Current anchors:
  `app/core/clients/proxy.py:3450-3467`,
  `app/modules/proxy/_service/streaming/helpers.py:861-868`,
  `app/modules/proxy/_service/compact.py:727-738`,
  `app/modules/proxy/_service/transcribe.py:230-232`,
  `app/core/clients/files.py:77-90`, and
  `app/modules/proxy/service.py:1464-1478`.
- Runtime clamps and derived effective values are not fully modeled. Current
  anchors: `app/core/clients/proxy.py:1049-1088`,
  `app/core/auth/refresh.py:391-395`, and
  `app/modules/proxy/load_balancer.py:1846-1856`.
- Runtime DB, API-key, and model-source settings can affect timeout-bearing
  paths without startup revalidation. Current anchors:
  `app/core/config/settings_cache.py:22-36`,
  `app/modules/settings/api.py:547-710`,
  `app/modules/proxy/_service/streaming/retry.py:153-165`, and
  `app/modules/model_sources/forwarding.py:112-221`.

Example: `python -m app.core.timeout_invariants --strict` validates the
startup `Settings` view and exits nonzero when any enforced rule fails.
Running the same command without `--strict` reports violations but exits zero,
matching the default startup behavior.

`CODEX_LB_TIMEOUT_INVARIANT_VALIDATION_STRICT` is intentionally a setting
rather than a hard default because existing deployments may carry legacy timeout
values that deserve CRITICAL diagnostics first, not surprise startup refusal.
The default remains non-strict; operators and CI opt into fail-fast behavior.

## Helm termination-grace upgrade contract

The graceful-shutdown chart adds a render-time guard:
`terminationGracePeriodSeconds` must be at least
`config.shutdownDrainTimeoutSeconds + 32`. Existing values files, explicit
`--set` arguments, or values retained by `helm upgrade --reuse-values` below
that bound make `helm template`, `helm install`, and `helm upgrade` fail before
resources are applied. A failed upgrade leaves the existing release in place.

With the default 30-second drain timeout, the arithmetic minimum is 62 seconds
and the chart default is 65 seconds. An explicit retained value of 60 seconds,
the previous chart default, is therefore invalid. Before installing or
upgrading, raise every retained low value explicitly to at least the computed
minimum; setting 65 preserves the chart's default helper-launch headroom when
the drain timeout remains 30 seconds. Production overrides should retain
additional headroom for preStop helper launch.

For example, this retained value fails rendering:

```yaml
config:
  shutdownDrainTimeoutSeconds: 30
terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60
```

When `--reuse-values` is used, removing
`terminationGracePeriodSeconds` from a new values file or omitting its `--set`
argument does not clear the stored 60-second value. That upgrade must set the
key explicitly to at least 62 seconds; setting it to 65 preserves the chart's
three seconds of helper-launch headroom. To adopt the 65-second chart default
without storing an override, use an intentional non-reuse or `--reset-values`
upgrade with `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` absent.

## Raw socket peer preservation and proxy projection

codex-lb captures the incoming ASGI client before delegating once to Uvicorn's
proxy projection. Shipped launchers disable the outer server middleware so raw
transport policy can use the original peer while downstream handlers still see
the projected client and scheme. `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` remains the sole trust
input and is passed through unchanged.

For example, a TCP peer at `10.0.0.8` may project client `192.168.65.1` and
scheme `https`; raw-peer authorization still evaluates `10.0.0.8`.

## NEXT-RELEASE QUEUE (do not lose)

Work queued for the release after the one that shipped the
settings-surface reduction (issue #1340, phases 1-4 + retention dashboard
settings, merged as PRs #1351, #1360, #1362, #1363, #1364 in v1.21.x):

1. **Drop the deprecated prewarm request-log columns.** `RequestLog`
   still declares `prewarm_canary_bucket` and `prewarm_eligible_reason`
   (deprecated, unwritten since phase 4) so old replicas keep inserting
   safely during rolling upgrades — the Helm migration job is a
   pre-upgrade hook while the workload rolls. The Alembic drop revision
   MUST ship in the next release; it could not ship together with the
   writer removal.
2. **Retire the retention env aliases.**
   `CODEX_LB_REQUEST_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` and
   `CODEX_LB_USAGE_HISTORY_RETENTION_DAYS` are deprecated one-release
   aliases for the dashboard retention settings
   (`retention-dashboard-settings`). A follow-up phase removes the env
   fields and adds them to `_REMOVED_SETTINGS` with a pointer to the
   dashboard setting, once operators have had a release to migrate. See
   `openspec/specs/data-retention/context.md`.
3. **Eventually retire the removal warning itself.** `_REMOVED_SETTINGS`
   and `warn_removed_settings()` in `app/core/config/settings.py` are a
   one-release courtesy per removed batch ("at least one release"); prune
   entries (or the mechanism) once every batch has had its warning
   release. Item 2 adds entries first, so this comes last.

## Settings-surface reduction rationale (issue #1340, phases 1-4)

PRINCIPLES.md P2: "a setting the operator never needs to touch is a
default in disguise." The `Settings` class carried 165 env-settable fields
before phase 1; phases 1-4 removed 52 of them (plus adding `CODEX_LB_TRACE`).
Selection rule for every phase: removal is provably zero-risk — each
removed field keeps its exact previous default as the new fixed value, so
behavior is byte-identical for any install that never overrode it, and the
only behavioral seam (the removed-settings warning) is additive.

Capability choice: `deployment-installation` owns the operator env-var
contract at settings-load time (see the data-directory resolution
requirement), so the fixed-constants + removal-warning requirement lives
here rather than in `contribution-simplicity`, which governs the
contribution/review process, not runtime behavior.

### Removed fields by phase

Phase 1 (24 removed, 1 added; zero-risk internals):

- OAuth protocol identity (6): `CODEX_LB_AUTH_BASE_URL`
  (`https://auth.openai.com`), `CODEX_LB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
  (`app_EMoamEEZ73f0CkXaXp7hrann`), `CODEX_LB_OAUTH_ORIGINATOR`
  (`codex_chatgpt_desktop`), `CODEX_LB_OAUTH_SCOPE`
  (`openid profile email`), `CODEX_LB_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`
  (`http://localhost:1455/auth/callback`), `CODEX_LB_OAUTH_CALLBACK_PORT`
  (1455) — module constants in `app/core/config/settings.py`; changing any
  of them breaks login.
- Auth guardian tuning (7): interval 21600, max refresh age 43200, batch
  size 100, concurrency 3, jitter 300.0, failure backoff base 300.0 / max
  3600.0 — constants in `app/core/auth/guardian.py`;
  `CODEX_LB_AUTH_GUARDIAN_ENABLED` remains the single switch.
- Debug log booleans (6): the `CODEX_LB_LOG_PROXY_*` /
  `CODEX_LB_LOG_UPSTREAM_*` booleans became `CODEX_LB_TRACE` channels
  (`shape`, `shape_raw_cache_key`, `payload`, `service_tier`,
  `upstream_summary`, `upstream_payload`); empty default = all off. This
  is an incident-debugging knob for interactive use only; there is no
  correct steady-state value other than "off".
- Bulkhead per-class overrides (3): http/websocket/compact limits always
  derive from `CODEX_LB_BULKHEAD_PROXY_LIMIT` (http = websocket = proxy
  limit; compact = min(http, 16), 0 when http is 0).
- Token-refresh claim polling (2): wait 8.0 s, poll 0.25 s — constants in
  `app/modules/accounts/auth_manager.py`.
  `CODEX_LB_TOKEN_REFRESH_CLAIM_TTL_SECONDS` stays: its floor validation
  against `proxy_admission_wait_timeout_seconds + 2 x
  token_refresh_timeout_seconds` protects the cross-replica single-use
  refresh-token invariant and references settings that remain
  configurable.

Phase 2 (15 removed):

- Scheduler cadences (4): quota planner tick 300 s (the old
  `max(60, ...)` clamp became moot and was dropped), automations poll
  30 s, model-registry refresh 300 s, sticky-session cleanup 300 s —
  constants next to their scheduler builders; every `*_ENABLED` switch
  remains.
- Codex client fingerprint (3): OS `Mac OS 26.5.0`, arch `arm64`,
  terminal `iTerm.app/3.6.10` — `_FINGERPRINT_*` constants in
  `app/core/clients/proxy.py`, maintained in lockstep with
  `CODEX_LB_MODEL_REGISTRY_CLIENT_VERSION` bumps (which stays a setting:
  it doubles as the degraded-startup catalog floor).
- Live-usage write coalescing (2): min interval 5.0 s, queue size 512 —
  constants in `app/modules/usage/live_ingest.py`.
- Request-log count-cache TTL (1): fixed 30.0 s in
  `app/modules/request_logs/repository.py` (the test suite patches the
  constant to 0 where exact totals matter).
- Circuit-breaker tuning (2): failure threshold 5, recovery timeout 60 s
  — constants in `app/core/resilience/circuit_breaker.py`. The Helm chart
  values `config.circuitBreakerFailureThreshold`,
  `config.circuitBreakerRecoveryTimeoutSeconds`, and
  `config.stickySessionCleanupIntervalSeconds` were removed in the same
  change so a default install does not trip its own removal warning.
- Memory warning threshold (1): derived as 80% of
  `CODEX_LB_MEMORY_REJECT_THRESHOLD_MB` in
  `app/core/resilience/memory_monitor.py`. The warning has no meaning on
  its own — it exists to announce that the reject threshold is being
  approached. The only lost configuration is a warning-only setup with no
  reject threshold, an observability half-measure the log stream covers
  anyway. `CODEX_LB_MEMORY_REJECT_THRESHOLD_MB` stays: it is the one
  genuine deployment decision (it depends on host memory size), default 0
  = fully off.
- Images internals (2): host model fixed to `gpt-5.5`
  (`_IMAGES_HOST_MODEL` in `app/modules/proxy/api.py`; the model registry
  has no "default Responses model" concept, so a documented constant
  tracking the bootstrap catalog beats inventing registry plumbing —
  never echoed to clients) and partial-images cap fixed to 3 in
  `app/core/openai/images.py` (an upstream streaming contract).
  `CODEX_LB_IMAGES_DEFAULT_MODEL` stays: the public API contract for
  clients that omit `model`.

Phase 3 (10 removed):

- DB pool tuning (4): background pool size / max overflow always derive
  from `database_pool_size` / `database_max_overflow` (nothing ever set
  the overrides; unconditional derivation also collapses the `background`
  branch out of the engine-kwargs helper so pre-ping/recycle regressions
  like #672 cannot diverge between the two engines); pool checkout
  timeout fixed 30.0 s and recycle window fixed 1800 s
  (`_POSTGRES_POOL_*` constants in `app/db/session.py`).
  `CODEX_LB_DATABASE_POOL_SIZE` / `CODEX_LB_DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW` stay:
  PostgreSQL HA operators must budget both independently pooled engines in
  every supported one-worker replica:
  `(pool_size + max_overflow) x 2 x replicas`, while reserving server
  connections for PostgreSQL internals, migrations, and operations. The owned
  CLI launcher pins one worker; custom multi-worker launchers are unsupported.
  The Helm chart pins both pool inputs.
- Soft-drain/probe thresholds (6): drain at 85%/90%, error window 60 s /
  count 2, probe quiet 60 s, success streak 3. They encode the
  deterministic-failover design and interlock — raising one without the
  others degrades failover in non-obvious ways — and
  `app/core/balancer/logic.py` already declared identical constants as
  `evaluate_health_tier` parameter defaults, so the settings were a second
  source of truth for numbers that must not drift. The function keeps its
  full parameter surface for tests; production call sites rely on the
  constant defaults. `CODEX_LB_SOFT_DRAIN_ENABLED` and
  `CODEX_LB_DETERMINISTIC_FAILOVER_ENABLED` stay as the subsystem
  switches.

Phase 4 (3 removed; prewarm canary scaffolding):

- `CODEX_LB_HTTP_RESPONSES_SESSION_BRIDGE_CODEX_PREWARM_CANARY_PERCENT`
  and the `..._ALLOW_API_KEY_IDS` / `..._DENY_API_KEY_IDS` cohort lists
  (plus their validator). The canary machinery was one-time rollout
  instrumentation for a finished experiment, not an operator contract.
  Production was verified live on 2026-07-15 before removal: every
  replica ran `prewarm_enabled=False`, percent unset (`None`), empty
  allow/deny lists — and the `canary_percent=None` code path (treat all
  eligible requests, `legacy_all`) is exactly the new unconditional
  behavior, so nothing changed for defaults or production.
  `..._PREWARM_ENABLED` stays (default off, mid-rollout): enabling it is
  a real operator decision; only the scoping machinery went away.
  `prewarm_status=canary_miss` is unreachable and removed from the
  observability contract; see
  `openspec/specs/proxy-runtime-observability/context.md`.
  If a future feature needs percentage or cohort-scoped rollout, that is
  a new OpenSpec change with its own design — re-introducing these
  settings verbatim is explicitly not the path.

## Deprecation policy for removed settings

`extra="ignore"` on `Settings` makes removed env vars inert the moment the
fields are deleted; the startup WARN (`warn_removed_settings()` in
`app/core/config/settings.py`, called from the `app/main.py` lifespan) is
one release of courtesy so operators notice stale configuration. The
warning lists names only, never values, and is removed together with its
`_REMOVED_SETTINGS` entries in a later release (see the next-release
queue above).

## Example

An operator running `CODEX_LB_LOG_UPSTREAM_REQUEST_PAYLOAD=true` upgrades:
startup logs

```
removed setting(s) ignored: CODEX_LB_LOG_UPSTREAM_REQUEST_PAYLOAD — values are now fixed; see PRINCIPLES.md P2 / issue #1340
```

and the equivalent incident-debugging behavior is re-enabled interactively
with `CODEX_LB_TRACE=upstream_payload`. Startup never fails because of a
removed setting, and the fixed built-in value is used.
