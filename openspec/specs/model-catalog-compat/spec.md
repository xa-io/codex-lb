## Requirements
### Requirement: Bootstrap model catalog is available before refresh

Before the first successful upstream model-registry refresh, the system MUST
serve a conservative static catalog of known Codex model slugs from both
`GET /v1/models` and `GET /backend-api/codex/models`. This static catalog is a
bundled fallback for startup/offline paths; refreshed upstream model-registry
data remains the authoritative source once available. A replica that starts
while a fresh persisted registry snapshot exists SHALL serve the persisted
catalog (not the bootstrap catalog) before its first scheduler tick; the
bootstrap catalog remains the floor only when no persisted or refreshed
snapshot is available. The bootstrap catalog MUST
include `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.6-luna`, `gpt-5.5`,
`gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.3-codex`, `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`,
`gpt-5.2`, and `codex-auto-review`, and MUST NOT invent unverified variant
slugs such as `gpt-5.5-pro` or a bare `gpt-5.6`. `gpt-5.3-codex` and
`gpt-5.3-codex-spark` were dropped from upstream's bundled catalog at
codex rust-v0.144.x but remain retained for older pinned clients because the
upstream backend still serves them.

#### Scenario: OpenAI-compatible models endpoint serves bootstrap slugs

- **GIVEN** the model registry has no refreshed upstream snapshot
- **AND** no persisted registry snapshot is available
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /v1/models`
- **THEN** the response contains exactly the bootstrap model slugs
- **AND** the response includes `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna`
- **AND** the response does not include `gpt-5.5-pro` or bare `gpt-5.6`

#### Scenario: Codex-native models endpoint serves GPT-5.6 bootstrap metadata

- **GIVEN** the model registry has no refreshed upstream snapshot
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /backend-api/codex/models`
- **THEN** the `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna` entries include representative upstream metadata including context-window, visibility, speed-tier, and reasoning fields
- **AND** Sol and Terra advertise `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, and `ultra`
- **AND** Luna advertises `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`

#### Scenario: Replica startup with a fresh persisted snapshot serves the persisted catalog

- **GIVEN** a fresh persisted registry snapshot exists whose catalog differs from the bootstrap catalog
- **WHEN** a replica starts and a client calls `GET /v1/models` before the first refresh tick
- **THEN** the response reflects the persisted catalog, not the bootstrap catalog

### Requirement: Refreshed upstream model data remains authoritative

The system MUST treat a refreshed upstream model-registry snapshot as
authoritative over the static bootstrap catalog. Once that snapshot exists,
model catalog endpoints and model-behavior lookups MUST use the refreshed
snapshot instead of the static bootstrap catalog. Before refresh, websocket
preference lookup and account plan filtering MUST use bootstrap model metadata
when the requested slug matches a bootstrap entry.

#### Scenario: Refreshed snapshot replaces bootstrap catalog

- **GIVEN** the model registry has a refreshed upstream snapshot
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /v1/models` or `GET /backend-api/codex/models`
- **THEN** the response is built from the refreshed snapshot
- **AND** bootstrap-only entries are not added to the response

#### Scenario: Non-authoritative refresh preserves bootstrap floor

- **GIVEN** the model registry does not have authoritative account-catalog coverage
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /v1/models`, `GET /backend-api/codex/models`, or a routing path checks websocket preference or allowed plans for a bootstrap model that is absent from the partial snapshot
- **THEN** the system still uses the bootstrap catalog entry for that model as the discovery and plan-gating floor
- **AND** exact supporting-account routing remains unknown until authoritative account-catalog coverage exists

#### Scenario: Non-authoritative refresh does not resurrect dead bootstrap models

- **GIVEN** the latest non-authoritative snapshot knows that every last-known advertiser of a bootstrap model is inactive or removed
- **WHEN** discovery or plan gating is evaluated for that model before any authoritative refresh completes
- **THEN** the model remains absent instead of reappearing from the bootstrap floor

#### Scenario: Repeated non-authoritative refreshes keep removed bootstrap models suppressed

- **GIVEN** a non-authoritative snapshot suppressed a bootstrap model because every last-known advertiser left the active account set
- **WHEN** later refresh cycles still lack authoritative account-catalog coverage and still do not produce fresh active evidence for that model
- **THEN** the model stays absent from discovery and plan gating across those repeated refreshes

#### Scenario: Fresh active evidence clears bootstrap suppression

- **GIVEN** a bootstrap model was previously suppressed after its last-known advertisers left the active account set
- **WHEN** a later refresh records that an active account advertises that model again
- **THEN** the suppression is cleared
- **AND** the model returns to discovery and plan gating from live registry data

#### Scenario: Bootstrap websocket preference is honored before refresh

- **GIVEN** the model registry has no refreshed upstream snapshot
- **WHEN** websocket preference is checked for a bootstrap model marked as websocket-preferred
- **THEN** the lookup returns that bootstrap preference

#### Scenario: Bootstrap plan metadata filters accounts before refresh

- **GIVEN** the model registry has no refreshed upstream snapshot
- **AND** a bootstrap model excludes a plan from its plan-availability metadata
- **WHEN** account selection is requested for that bootstrap model
- **THEN** accounts on excluded plans are not selected for that model

### Requirement: OpenAI-compatible model metadata uses backend context windows

When serving `GET /v1/models`, the system SHALL expose `metadata.context_window` as the upstream backend `context_window` budget by default. The system MUST NOT promote raw `max_context_window` values or hard-coded full-context guesses into `metadata.context_window`. Explicit operator context-window overrides remain the highest-priority reported-context value.

#### Scenario: GPT-5 Codex models are reported with the backend context window on /v1/models

- **WHEN** the upstream model catalog contains `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.3-codex`, or `gpt-5.4` with `context_window=272000`
- **THEN** `GET /v1/models` returns each entry with `metadata.context_window=272000`

#### Scenario: raw max_context_window does not inflate /v1/models context_window

- **WHEN** the upstream model catalog contains a model with `context_window=272000` and `max_context_window=900000`
- **THEN** `GET /v1/models` returns that entry with `metadata.context_window=272000`

### Requirement: OpenAI-compatible model metadata preserves the backend input budget explicitly

When serving `GET /v1/models`, the system SHALL expose the upstream backend input/context budget in `metadata.input_context_window`. For models whose reported `metadata.context_window` is not operator-overridden, `metadata.context_window` and `metadata.input_context_window` SHOULD be equal. The system SHOULD expose `metadata.max_output_tokens` for known GPT-5 Codex models when that output-budget value is known; that value MUST NOT be used to inflate `metadata.context_window`.

#### Scenario: /v1/models exposes the 272k backend input budget explicitly

- **WHEN** the upstream model catalog contains a known GPT-5 Codex model with `context_window=272000`
- **THEN** `GET /v1/models` returns that model with `metadata.input_context_window=272000`
- **AND** `metadata.context_window=272000`

#### Scenario: Explicit reported-context overrides do not hide the backend input budget

- **WHEN** an operator override sets a model's reported `metadata.context_window` to `515000`
- **AND** the upstream model catalog contains that model with `context_window=272000`
- **THEN** `GET /v1/models` returns that model with `metadata.context_window=515000`
- **AND** `metadata.input_context_window=272000`

#### Scenario: /v1/models exposes max output budget for known GPT-5 Codex models

- **WHEN** `GET /v1/models` returns `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, or `gpt-5.3-codex`
- **THEN** the entry's metadata includes `max_output_tokens=128000`

### Requirement: Codex-native model catalog keeps backend catalog fields

When serving `GET /backend-api/codex/models`, the system MUST keep Codex-native model catalog semantics unchanged: the top-level `context_window` field remains the backend compact/input budget unless an explicit operator override applies, and upstream raw fields such as `max_context_window` remain available when upstream provides them. The `/v1/models` compatibility metadata MUST NOT mutate the native Codex endpoint.

#### Scenario: Native Codex route preserves compact budget

- **WHEN** the upstream model catalog contains `gpt-5.5` with `context_window=272000`
- **THEN** `GET /backend-api/codex/models` returns `gpt-5.5.context_window=272000`
- **AND** it does not replace that field with `400000`

#### Scenario: Codex model catalog also exposes OpenAI data alias

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /backend-api/codex/models`
- **THEN** the response keeps the Codex-native `models` list
- **AND** the response includes `object: "list"` and an OpenAI-compatible `data` list
- **AND** `data` contains model entries whose Codex visibility is `list`
- **AND** `data` excludes entries whose Codex visibility is `hide`

### Requirement: OpenAI-compatible model metadata preserves speed tiers

When serving `GET /v1/models`, the system SHALL preserve upstream speed-tier metadata in each model's `metadata` object when upstream provides it. This includes `additional_speed_tiers`, `service_tiers`, and `default_service_tier`. The system MUST NOT invent speed tiers for models whose upstream catalog entry does not advertise them.

#### Scenario: /v1/models exposes upstream fast tier metadata

- **WHEN** the upstream model catalog contains `gpt-5.5` with `additional_speed_tiers=["fast"]`
- **AND** the upstream model catalog includes a `service_tiers` entry with `id="priority"` and `name="Fast"`
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /v1/models`
- **THEN** the `gpt-5.5` entry's metadata includes `additional_speed_tiers=["fast"]`
- **AND** the metadata includes the upstream `service_tiers` entry
- **AND** the metadata includes the upstream `default_service_tier` when present

### Requirement: GPT-5.6 bootstrap metadata matches the upstream bundled catalog

The GPT-5.6 bootstrap catalog entries (`gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`,
`gpt-5.6-luna`) MUST mirror the upstream bundled catalog
(`codex-rs/models-manager/models.json` at Codex release `rust-v0.145.0`)
field-for-field for every metadata field codex-lb serves, with one tracked
exception: `max_context_window`, which upstream raised from `272000` to
`872000` in openai/codex commit
`2eee483e49f88b868f67364134a658b3298e6c14` (openai/codex#39102) and which no
`rust-v*` release tag carries as of `rust-v0.148.0-alpha.21`. In particular
each entry MUST carry: `context_window` of `272000` and `max_context_window`
of `872000`; `minimal_client_version` `"0.144.0"`; `tool_mode`
`"code_mode_only"`; `use_responses_lite` `true`; `apply_patch_tool_type`
`"freeform"`; `web_search_tool_type` `"text_and_image"`;
`supports_image_detail_original` `true`; `truncation_policy` `{ "mode":
"tokens", "limit": 10000 }`; `comp_hash` `"3000"`; `reasoning_summary_format`
`"experimental"`; `default_reasoning_summary` `"none"`;
`include_skills_usage_instructions` `false`; `experimental_supported_tools`
`[]` (a field the Codex client's deserializer requires); `supports_search_tool`
`true`; `additional_speed_tiers` `["fast"]`; the `priority`/`Fast` service tier
entry; `shell_type` `"shell_command"`; `prefer_websockets` `true`; and the
21-plan `available_in_plans` list upstream advertises (including `edu_plus`,
`edu_pro`, `enterprise_cbp_automation`, and `sci`). `multi_agent_version` MUST
be `"v2"` for Sol and Terra and `"v1"` for Luna. Sol MUST carry the upstream
`availability_nux` message while Terra and Luna carry `null`. Default reasoning
levels MUST be `low` for Sol and `medium` for Terra and Luna, and
reasoning-level descriptions MUST be the verbatim upstream strings.

`context_window` is the default input budget and `max_context_window` is the
ceiling a client may opt into; the two MUST NOT be collapsed into one value
for these entries.

The ~16.5 KB upstream `base_instructions` prompt and the personality-templated
`model_messages` object are deliberately NOT bundled in the bootstrap catalog;
the first successful live registry refresh supplies them. This is the only
sanctioned divergence from the upstream GPT-5.6 entries beyond the
`max_context_window` exception above.

#### Scenario: GPT-5.6 bootstrap entries retain the corrected upstream context budget

- **GIVEN** the model registry has no refreshed upstream snapshot
- **AND** no persisted snapshot is loaded
- **AND** no `CODEX_LB_MODEL_CONTEXT_WINDOW_OVERRIDES` entry applies to these slugs
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /backend-api/codex/models`
- **THEN** `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna` report
  `context_window=272000`

#### Scenario: GPT-5.6 bootstrap entries advertise the raised upstream ceiling

- **GIVEN** the model registry has no refreshed upstream snapshot
- **AND** no persisted snapshot is loaded
- **AND** no `CODEX_LB_MODEL_CONTEXT_WINDOW_OVERRIDES` entry applies to these slugs
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /backend-api/codex/models`
- **THEN** `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna` report
  `context_window=272000`
- **AND** each reports `max_context_window=872000`

#### Scenario: OpenAI-compatible metadata keeps the default input budget

- **GIVEN** the model registry has no refreshed upstream snapshot
- **AND** no persisted snapshot is loaded
- **AND** no `CODEX_LB_MODEL_CONTEXT_WINDOW_OVERRIDES` entry applies to these slugs
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /v1/models`
- **THEN** each GPT-5.6 entry reports `context_window=272000` and
  `input_context_window=272000`
- **AND** the raised Codex-native ceiling is not promoted into the
  OpenAI-compatible input budget fields

#### Scenario: GPT-5.6 entries expose upstream tool and multi-agent metadata

- **GIVEN** the model registry has no refreshed upstream snapshot
- **AND** no persisted snapshot is loaded
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /backend-api/codex/models`
- **THEN** `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna` carry `tool_mode: "code_mode_only"`, `use_responses_lite: true`, `experimental_supported_tools: []`, and `minimal_client_version: "0.144.0"`
- **AND** `multi_agent_version` is `"v2"` for Sol and Terra and `"v1"` for Luna

#### Scenario: GPT-5.6 entries expose upstream reasoning-summary and plan metadata

- **GIVEN** the model registry has no refreshed upstream snapshot
- **AND** no persisted snapshot is loaded
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /backend-api/codex/models`
- **THEN** each GPT-5.6 entry carries `default_reasoning_summary: "none"`, `reasoning_summary_format: "experimental"`, and `comp_hash: "3000"`
- **AND** each GPT-5.6 entry's `available_in_plans` includes `edu_plus`, `edu_pro`, `enterprise_cbp_automation`, and `sci`
- **AND** only `gpt-5.6-sol` carries a non-null `availability_nux` message

### Requirement: Fallback client version covers the bootstrap catalog

The configured fallback Codex client version (used when the live Codex release lookup fails and no cached version exists) MUST be greater than or equal to the highest `minimal_client_version` in the bootstrap catalog, so a degraded-startup registry refresh still receives the newest bootstrap models from upstream.

#### Scenario: Degraded-startup refresh still requests GPT-5.6

- **GIVEN** the live Codex release lookup fails and no version is cached
- **WHEN** the model registry refresh fetches `<base>/codex/models?client_version=<fallback>`
- **THEN** the fallback version is at least `0.144.0` (GPT-5.6's `minimal_client_version`)

### Requirement: Dashboard model metadata exposes supported reasoning efforts

When serving `GET /api/models`, the system MUST expose the supported reasoning
efforts advertised by each public model catalog entry. The response MUST include
new upstream-supported efforts such as `max` and `ultra` instead of filtering
them out.

#### Scenario: Dashboard model list exposes GPT-5.6 reasoning efforts

- **WHEN** the model catalog contains `gpt-5.6-sol` with supported efforts `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, and `ultra`
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /api/models`
- **THEN** the `gpt-5.6-sol` entry's `supportedReasoningEfforts` includes `max` and `ultra`
- **AND** `defaultReasoningEffort` reflects the catalog default

### Requirement: Source-model Codex catalog entries are Codex-parseable

Codex catalog entries built for OpenAI-compatible source models MUST be
parseable by Codex clients without relying on bundled metadata. When the
source model has no configured context window, the entry MUST report a
context window of 128,000 tokens and a matching `max_context_window`. The
entry MUST include `shell_type` (`shell_command`), a `truncation_policy`,
and the client-capability fields `include_skills_usage_instructions`,
`supports_image_detail_original`, `supports_search_tool`,
`use_responses_lite`, and `experimental_supported_tools`, defaulting each to
its most conservative value. Operator-provided values for these keys in the
source model's `raw_metadata_json` MUST take precedence over the defaults.

#### Scenario: Source model without a context window gets the default budget

- **GIVEN** an enabled Responses-capable source model with no `contextWindow` configured
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /backend-api/codex/models`
- **THEN** the model's entry reports `context_window` of 128000
- **AND** `max_context_window` of 128000
- **AND** `shell_type` of `shell_command`
- **AND** conservative defaults for the client-capability fields (for example `supports_search_tool` is `false` and `use_responses_lite` is `false`)

#### Scenario: Operator capability opt-in overrides the defaults

- **GIVEN** a source model whose `raw_metadata_json` sets `"supports_search_tool": true`
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /backend-api/codex/models`
- **THEN** the model's entry reports `supports_search_tool` as `true`

### Requirement: Source request overrides never appear in client-visible catalogs

The per-model `source_request_overrides` object in a source model's `raw_metadata_json` is operator-side request configuration and MUST NOT
appear in any client-visible catalog payload (`GET /backend-api/codex/models`,
`GET /v1/models`, or any equivalent catalog route), while remaining available
server-side for request override application.

#### Scenario: Override config is stripped from the Codex catalog

- **GIVEN** a source model whose `raw_metadata_json` contains `"source_request_overrides": {"options": {"num_ctx": 32768}}`
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /backend-api/codex/models`
- **THEN** the model's catalog entry does not contain a `source_request_overrides` key
- **AND** the string `source_request_overrides` appears nowhere in the response payload

#### Scenario: Overrides still apply to forwarded requests

- **GIVEN** the same source model
- **WHEN** a Responses request is forwarded to the source
- **THEN** the forwarded payload includes the configured override values

### Requirement: Upstream model_messages is preserved in the catalog

When parsing upstream model-registry data, the system MUST preserve the
`model_messages` field on each model entry through to the Codex-native catalog
response. The field MUST NOT be stripped during fetch parsing, registry
storage, or catalog serialization. `GET /backend-api/codex/models` and
`GET /v1/models?client_version=<v>` MUST return each model's `model_messages`
object unchanged from the upstream response once a refreshed registry snapshot
exists.

#### Scenario: model_messages survives the fetch → registry → catalog path

- **GIVEN** the upstream model catalog contains a model with a `model_messages` object
- **WHEN** the model registry refresh parses the upstream response
- **THEN** the resulting `UpstreamModel.raw` includes `model_messages` unchanged

#### Scenario: Codex-native catalog endpoint returns model_messages

- **GIVEN** the model registry has a refreshed snapshot containing a model with `model_messages`
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /backend-api/codex/models`
- **THEN** the model entry in the response includes `model_messages` with the same value as the upstream response

#### Scenario: OpenAI-compatible catalog endpoint returns model_messages for Codex clients

- **GIVEN** the model registry has a refreshed snapshot containing a model with `model_messages`
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /v1/models?client_version=<v>`
- **THEN** the model entry in the response includes `model_messages` with the same value as the upstream response

### Requirement: Codex metadata survives a partial live catalog refresh

The proxy MUST retain the last successfully fetched complete metadata for a
bundled Codex model when a later successful live catalog refresh omits that
model. A retained model that is absent from the current live availability snapshot MUST be
returned through the Codex model catalog with hidden visibility so an explicitly
configured client can resolve its metadata without advertising it in the model
picker.

Retained metadata MUST NOT add the model to current plan, account, service-tier,
routing, dashboard, warmup, or `/v1/models` availability. A current live entry
MUST replace the retained entry when the model appears again.
Models outside the bundled Codex catalog MUST NOT be retained after they leave
the current live availability snapshot.

OpenAI-compatible source entries that share a slug with retained Codex metadata
MUST replace retained metadata only when the source entry's effective Codex
visibility is `list` for the requesting client. A same-slug source entry hidden
by raw catalog visibility or by the API key's exact source allowlist MUST NOT
shadow the retained metadata.

#### Scenario: Sol metadata remains resolvable after a partial refresh

- **GIVEN** a successful live catalog refresh returned complete metadata for `gpt-5.6-sol`
- **WHEN** a later successful refresh omits `gpt-5.6-sol`
- **THEN** the Codex catalog includes the last complete Sol metadata with hidden visibility
- **AND** `/v1/models` and live availability indexes omit Sol

#### Scenario: A later live entry replaces retained metadata

- **GIVEN** metadata was retained for a model omitted by a previous refresh
- **WHEN** a later live refresh returns that model with updated metadata
- **THEN** the updated live metadata is used and the model follows its current live visibility

#### Scenario: Hidden source entry does not replace retained metadata

- **GIVEN** metadata was retained for `gpt-5.6-sol`
- **AND** an OpenAI-compatible source exposes the same `gpt-5.6-sol` slug
- **AND** that source entry is hidden from the effective Codex catalog by raw visibility or an API key's exact source allowlist
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /backend-api/codex/models` with that API key
- **THEN** the hidden Sol catalog entry uses the retained Codex metadata

#### Scenario: Visible same-slug source follows an earlier hidden source

- **GIVEN** multiple enabled sources expose the same model slug
- **AND** an earlier source is hidden while a later source is list-visible
- **WHEN** the Codex catalog is rendered
- **THEN** the list-visible source entry MUST take precedence for that slug
- **AND** the earlier hidden source MUST NOT suppress or replace it

#### Scenario: Bundled model appears on only one account in a plan

- **GIVEN** a same-plan refresh returns a bundled Codex model from one successful account but omits it from another
- **WHEN** the availability intersection excludes that model
- **THEN** the model MUST remain absent from live availability indexes
- **AND** its complete per-account live entry MUST refresh the metadata-only catalog

### Requirement: Complete account catalogs constrain pooled routing

The system MUST retain the union of successfully refreshed account model
catalogs for client discovery. When every active account has a current or
retained last-known catalog, request selection MUST route a model or explicit
non-default service tier only to accounts whose own catalog advertised that
capability. Requests that omit a tier or use the omit-equivalent `auto` or
`default` tiers MUST use model-only account filtering, including when reusing
an HTTP bridge session.

A service tier imposed by an API key's enforced service tier is not an explicit
request for that tier. When the requested tier originates from API key
enforcement and the model's catalog does not advertise that tier at all, the
system MUST remove the tier from the account-routed request, MUST select
accounts and reuse HTTP bridge sessions using model-only filtering, MUST
reserve, settle, and log API-key usage at the effective default tier, and MUST
omit the unsupported tier from the upstream request. This account-catalog
fallback MUST NOT alter a request selected for an external model source, and an
unknown or account-catalog-absent model MUST retain the enforced tier. When the model's catalog
does advertise the tier, account-level tier filtering MUST continue to apply
regardless of the tier's origin. A tier supplied explicitly by the client MUST
continue to filter accounts even when it equals the enforced value or uses an
equivalent alias and the model does not advertise it. When an
unavailable service tier is what excluded every account, the selection error
MUST name that tier.

#### Scenario: Same-plan accounts expose different models

- **GIVEN** two active accounts share a plan
- **AND** only one account advertises a model
- **WHEN** all active account catalogs are known
- **THEN** the merged discovery catalog includes the model
- **AND** requests for that model select only the advertising account

#### Scenario: Same-plan accounts expose different Fast tiers

- **GIVEN** two active accounts advertise the same model
- **AND** only one advertises the priority service tier
- **WHEN** a request explicitly asks for priority
- **THEN** selection considers only the account that advertised priority

#### Scenario: Enforced tier does not exclude a model that never advertises it

- **GIVEN** an active account advertises a model at its default tier
- **AND** the model's catalog advertises no `priority` service tier
- **AND** an API key sets `enforced_service_tier` to `priority`
- **WHEN** account selection is requested for that model
- **THEN** the enforced tier is removed from the account-routed request
- **AND** API-key accounting, bridge compatibility, and upstream forwarding use the effective default tier
- **AND** the advertising account is selected

#### Scenario: Account-catalog fallback does not alter a model source

- **GIVEN** an API key enforces the `priority` service tier
- **AND** the selected model is routed through an external model source
- **WHEN** the subscription-account catalog does not advertise `priority` for that model
- **THEN** the source-routed request retains `priority`

#### Scenario: Explicitly requested unadvertised tier is still rejected

- **GIVEN** an active account advertises a model at its default tier
- **AND** the model's catalog advertises no `priority` service tier
- **WHEN** a client explicitly requests that model with `priority` or an equivalent `fast` alias
- **THEN** no account is selected

#### Scenario: Unavailable advertised tier names the tier in the error

- **GIVEN** a model's catalog advertises the `priority` service tier
- **AND** no active account carries `priority` for that model
- **WHEN** account selection is requested for that model with `priority`
- **THEN** no account is selected
- **AND** the selection error names the `priority` service tier

### Requirement: Unknown account catalogs degrade without false exclusion

The system MUST distinguish an account catalog that successfully omitted a
capability from an account catalog that could not be fetched. If any active
account has neither a current nor retained last-known catalog, account-level
capability indexes MUST NOT be treated as authoritative and selection MUST use
the existing plan-level fallback. Operator-mapped model slugs MUST NOT be
rejected solely because they are absent from subscription catalog discovery.
An otherwise authoritative snapshot whose account set does not cover every
currently selectable account MUST likewise degrade to plan-level routing until
account catalog coverage catches up.

When there is no authoritative account coverage — including partial refreshes
after prior successful cycles and when every account is removed and live
capability state is cleared — the static bootstrap catalog MUST remain the
discovery and plan-gating floor. Clearing capability state MUST NOT publish an
authoritative-empty catalog that reports canonical models as absent;
otherwise, in the window after an account is added but before the next
scheduled refresh, model/plan filtering would be skipped (an unsupported plan
could be selected) and `/v1/models` would report no models.

Carrying a plan's catalog forward when its refresh does not complete MUST NOT
re-advertise a model that no currently-active account of that plan advertises,
per the last-known per-account catalogs. This drop invariant MUST hold
regardless of whether the previous snapshot was authoritative: the authoritative
distinction governs whether per-account routing is trusted, not whether a dead
model is dropped from discovery. When a carried-forward model has no per-account
provenance at all (an older or plan-only snapshot that never captured per-account
catalogs), the system MUST preserve it rather than drop it, degrading safe when a
model cannot be attributed to any account.

A retained account catalog MUST remain associated with the plan type that
produced it. If an active account changes plan type and its new catalog refresh
fails, the system MUST leave that account's catalog unknown rather than
re-labeling its old capabilities as support for the new plan. Any previously
advertised catalog slug explicitly suppressed because all its known advertisers
left the active set MUST still enter plan filtering and select no account,
whether or not it is part of the static bootstrap catalog; this is distinct from
an operator-mapped slug that has no catalog evidence at all.

#### Scenario: Catalog fetch partially fails after restart

- **GIVEN** there is no previous registry snapshot
- **AND** one active account catalog refresh succeeds while another fails
- **WHEN** selection evaluates a model or service tier
- **THEN** the partial index is non-authoritative
- **AND** the failed account is not classified as lacking every capability

#### Scenario: No active accounts fall back to the bootstrap floor

- **GIVEN** live capability state is cleared because no active accounts remain
- **WHEN** an account is added before the next scheduled refresh completes
- **THEN** canonical bootstrap models remain discoverable via `/v1/models`
- **AND** those models remain plan-gated by the bootstrap catalog
- **AND** an account whose plan does not support the model is not selected

#### Scenario: Failed refresh has last-known account data

- **GIVEN** every active account had a successful earlier catalog
- **AND** one account fails a later refresh
- **WHEN** that account remains active
- **THEN** its last-known capability data is retained
- **AND** the complete snapshot remains authoritative

#### Scenario: Successful empty catalog withdraws stale capabilities

- **GIVEN** an active account previously advertised a model
- **AND** its later catalog refresh succeeds with an empty model list
- **WHEN** the next registry snapshot is built
- **THEN** the empty catalog is treated as successful account coverage
- **AND** the previously advertised model leaves discovery and exact routing

#### Scenario: Metadata-only account model stays unroutable during partial refresh

- **GIVEN** an account catalog contains a model omitted from the plan discovery catalog
- **AND** a later refresh retains that account's stale catalog
- **WHEN** the next registry snapshot is built
- **THEN** the metadata-only model does not enter model, plan, account, or service-tier routing indexes

#### Scenario: Fresh metadata-only model stays out of routing indexes

- **GIVEN** a refreshed account catalog contains a model omitted from the merged discovery catalog
- **WHEN** the registry builds account and service-tier routing indexes
- **THEN** the metadata-only model does not enter either routing index

#### Scenario: Selectable account set is newer than registry coverage

- **GIVEN** an authoritative registry snapshot covers the previously selectable accounts
- **AND** a newly imported or reactivated account becomes selectable before the next catalog refresh
- **WHEN** request selection evaluates model or service-tier support
- **THEN** account-level indexes are treated as incomplete
- **AND** selection degrades to plan-level routing

#### Scenario: Bridge owner is newer than registry coverage

- **GIVEN** an HTTP bridge session belongs to a selectable account absent from the registry snapshot
- **WHEN** a compatible follow-up evaluates model or service-tier support
- **THEN** stale account-level indexes do not detach the bridge owner
- **AND** compatibility degrades to plan-level routing

#### Scenario: Failed refresh follows an account plan-type change

- **GIVEN** an account previously advertised a catalog while on one plan type
- **AND** the active account record now has a different plan type
- **AND** its catalog refresh fails in that cycle
- **WHEN** the next registry snapshot is built
- **THEN** the prior catalog is not retained for that account
- **AND** the account remains unknown until a catalog for its current plan is fetched

#### Scenario: Account is paused or removed

- **GIVEN** an account has retained catalog capabilities
- **WHEN** it is no longer in the active account set
- **THEN** its capabilities no longer contribute to discovery or routing

#### Scenario: Removed account is the sole advertiser within a stale plan

- **GIVEN** two accounts share a plan and only one advertised a given model
- **AND** the plan's refresh does not complete this cycle, so its catalog is carried forward
- **AND** the sole advertiser is no longer in the active account set
- **AND** the other account of that plan remains active
- **WHEN** the stale plan's retained catalog is merged into discovery
- **THEN** the model advertised only by the removed account leaves discovery
- **AND** the models still advertised by the remaining active account are retained

#### Scenario: Sole advertiser removed under a non-authoritative previous snapshot

- **GIVEN** a first refresh recorded a model advertised by one account of a plan
- **AND** a same-plan account had no catalog, so the snapshot is non-authoritative
- **WHEN** that sole advertiser is removed while another same-plan account stays active
- **AND** the plan's refresh does not complete in a later cycle
- **THEN** the model advertised only by the removed account still leaves discovery

#### Scenario: Removed catalog model stays suppressed across repeated partial refreshes

- **GIVEN** a snapshot suppressed a previously advertised catalog model because every last-known advertiser left the active account set
- **WHEN** later refresh cycles remain non-authoritative and still do not produce fresh active evidence for that model
- **THEN** the model stays absent from discovery and plan gating across those repeated partial refreshes

#### Scenario: Suppressed catalog model cannot select an account

- **GIVEN** a snapshot explicitly suppresses a previously advertised model because no active account advertises it
- **WHEN** account selection receives a request for that model
- **THEN** the selector rejects every account for that model
- **AND** it does not treat the known suppressed slug as an operator-mapped unknown

#### Scenario: First complete catalog suppresses omitted bootstrap model

- **GIVEN** there is no previous registry snapshot
- **AND** a bootstrap model slug is known to the proxy
- **WHEN** the first authoritative account-catalog refresh omits that model
- **THEN** the registry marks the omitted bootstrap slug as suppressed
- **AND** account selection does not treat that known slug as an operator-mapped unknown

#### Scenario: Fresh active evidence clears catalog suppression

- **GIVEN** a catalog model was previously suppressed after its last-known advertisers left the active account set
- **WHEN** a later refresh records that an active account advertises that model again
- **THEN** the suppression is cleared
- **AND** the model returns to discovery and plan gating from live registry data

#### Scenario: Never-known operator mapping remains distinct from suppression

- **GIVEN** an operator-mapped slug has never appeared in an account catalog
- **WHEN** an authoritative catalog snapshot does not contain that slug
- **THEN** the registry does not mark the slug as suppressed
- **AND** the existing operator-mapped unknown fallback remains available

#### Scenario: Carried-forward model has unknown per-account provenance

- **GIVEN** a plan-only snapshot carried a model with no per-account provenance
- **WHEN** the plan is stale in a later refresh that knows the active account set
- **THEN** the model is preserved in discovery rather than dropped

### Requirement: Speed and service tier metadata aggregates across accounts

When the model registry merges catalog entries for the same model slug fetched from multiple plans or accounts, the system MUST union the model's `service_tiers`, `additional_speed_tiers`, and `default_service_tier` metadata across all contributing entries rather than overwriting them with the last-fetched entry. A slug MUST expose a speed/service tier when at least one contributing account advertises it, so an account without Fast entitlement cannot remove Fast from the shared catalog served by `GET /v1/models` and `GET /backend-api/codex/models`. Union entries MUST be de-duplicated. All non-tier model fields MAY retain last-fetched values.

#### Scenario: An account without Fast does not hide Fast globally

- **GIVEN** one account/plan returns `gpt-5.5` with a `fast` service tier
- **AND** another account/plan returns `gpt-5.5` with no `fast` service tier
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /backend-api/codex/models`
- **THEN** the `gpt-5.5` entry includes the `fast` service tier
- **AND** the `fast` entry appears exactly once

#### Scenario: Shared tiers are not duplicated

- **GIVEN** two accounts both return `gpt-5.5` with the same `fast` service tier
- **WHEN** the registry merges the two catalog snapshots
- **THEN** the merged `gpt-5.5` service tiers contain a single `fast` entry

### Requirement: Codex clients receive the Codex catalog from /v1/models

When `GET /v1/models` is called with a non-empty `client_version` query parameter, the service MUST return the same Codex catalog payload as `GET /backend-api/codex/models`, including its `models` entries and the OpenAI-compatible `object`/`data` fields. When the parameter is absent or empty, the service MUST return the unchanged OpenAI-compatible list shape. API-key model filtering and visibility rules MUST apply in both cases.

#### Scenario: Codex client fetches its catalog through the /v1 base URL

- **GIVEN** a Codex client configured with `openai_base_url` pointing at this proxy
- **WHEN** it calls `GET /v1/models?client_version=0.144.1`
- **THEN** the response contains Codex catalog entries under `models`
- **AND** the payload equals the response of `GET /backend-api/codex/models`

#### Scenario: OpenAI-compatible clients are unaffected

- **GIVEN** an OpenAI-compatible client
- **WHEN** it calls `GET /v1/models` without a `client_version` parameter (or with an empty value)
- **THEN** the response keeps the `{"object": "list", "data": [...]}` shape

### Requirement: Model catalog entries preserve model-source identity

The model registry SHALL represent each catalog entry with explicit model-source
identity. Subscription-backed entries SHALL use a subscription source kind and
MUST continue to derive account/plan availability from the existing ChatGPT
account model registry refresh. OpenAI-compatible endpoint entries SHALL use an
OpenAI-compatible source kind and a stable source id. The model-source
abstraction MUST NOT require OpenAI-compatible sources to be represented as
`Account` rows.

#### Scenario: Subscription model keeps subscription source identity

- **WHEN** the existing model refresh loads `gpt-5.4` from ChatGPT/Codex account metadata
- **THEN** the registry entry has source kind `subscription`
- **AND** the entry remains eligible for existing account/plan routing

#### Scenario: OpenAI-compatible model keeps endpoint source identity

- **WHEN** an enabled OpenAI-compatible source defines model `local-coder`
- **THEN** the registry entry has source kind `openai_compatible`
- **AND** the entry references the source id for that endpoint
- **AND** no `Account` row is required for that source

### Requirement: /v1/models includes eligible OpenAI-compatible source models

`GET /v1/models` SHALL include enabled OpenAI-compatible source models alongside
subscription-backed public models when the authenticated API key is allowed to
see the model and source. Disabled sources and disabled source models MUST NOT be
listed. Source identity MAY be omitted from the public OpenAI-compatible model
payload, but internal filtering and routing MUST preserve it.

#### Scenario: API key sees assigned source model

- **GIVEN** an enabled OpenAI-compatible source exposes model `local-coder`
- **AND** an API key is assigned to that source and allows `local-coder`
- **WHEN** the key calls `GET /v1/models`
- **THEN** the response includes `local-coder`

#### Scenario: API key cannot see unassigned source model

- **GIVEN** an enabled OpenAI-compatible source exposes model `local-coder`
- **AND** an API key is scoped to a different source
- **WHEN** the key calls `GET /v1/models`
- **THEN** the response does not include `local-coder`

### Requirement: Codex-native catalog includes only Responses-capable source models

`GET /backend-api/codex/models` SHALL include OpenAI-compatible source models
only when the source explicitly declares Responses-compatible support. This
allows Codex model-picker entries for external providers without advertising
Chat Completions-only sources that cannot satisfy Codex-native Responses
requests. Disabled sources and disabled source models MUST NOT be listed.
Subscription-backed Codex catalog entries MUST continue to be listed through the
existing registry path. If a source model entry emits `model_provider`, it MUST
emit `codex-lb` and MUST NOT advertise the external upstream provider name.

#### Scenario: Responses-capable source is advertised to Codex-native clients

- **GIVEN** an enabled OpenAI-compatible source exposes model `deepseek-v4-flash`
- **AND** the source declares Responses-compatible support
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /backend-api/codex/models`
- **THEN** the response includes `deepseek-v4-flash`
- **AND** the model entry does not change the Codex provider away from `codex-lb`

#### Scenario: Chat-only source is not advertised to Codex-native clients

- **GIVEN** an enabled OpenAI-compatible source exposes model `local-coder`
- **AND** the source declares Chat Completions support only
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /backend-api/codex/models`
- **THEN** the response does not include `local-coder`

### Requirement: Refreshed model catalog is replica-coherent

The leader refresh cycle SHALL persist the complete registry state (models, plan maps, per-account tier maps, suppression set, authoritative flags, metadata retention state, and the refresh wall-clock timestamp) to the single-row `model_registry_snapshot` table and SHALL bump the `model_registry` cache-invalidation namespace only after the persist commits (write-then-bump). The payload write and the bump SHALL be skipped when the serialized content hash is unchanged from the last persisted state AND the stored row was still within `model_registry_snapshot_max_age_seconds`; the stored `refreshed_at` timestamp SHALL still be advanced so snapshot age reflects the leader's latest successful refresh. When the content hash is unchanged but the stored row had already aged past `model_registry_snapshot_max_age_seconds` before this refresh revived it, the leader SHALL still bump the `model_registry` namespace (only the payload rewrite stays skipped): an expired row causes followers to clear their local registry and reset their applied-content-hash marker, so an unchanged-content revival still requires a bump for them to re-apply within the cache-invalidation poll bound instead of waiting for the non-leader scheduler backstop. Every replica MUST apply a newly persisted snapshot within the cache-invalidation poll bound and MUST invalidate its local account-selection cache on apply; that account-selection invalidation MUST be local-only (non-propagating), because reconcile only applies a change the leader already published (which bumped `model_registry` to reach every replica) and each replica clears its own selection cache on apply, so a propagating clear would make every follower durably re-bump `account_selection` and amplify bus traffic with no peer-visible effect. When the reconcile is driven by the `model_registry` invalidation callback and the snapshot load fails (transient DB read error or malformed payload), the callback MUST surface the failure to the invalidation poller so the poller leaves the `model_registry` version unacknowledged and retries on the next poll cycle (matching the `account_routing` refresh callback), rather than acknowledging the bump and stranding the replica on the stale catalog until the non-leader scheduler backstop; the startup one-shot reconcile and the refresh-tick backstop instead swallow such a load failure (keeping the current in-memory state) so they never fail startup or the scheduler loop. Payload decode MUST treat a set-backed or mapping-backed catalog field whose persisted value has the wrong type — for example a `model_plans`/`plan_models`/`model_accounts`/per-account tier entry persisted as a scalar or object where a list of slugs is expected, or a model entry that is not an object — as a malformed payload and raise, rather than silently dropping the offending entry and applying a partial catalog; a genuinely-absent or empty container (an absent key, an empty map, or an empty list) is not malformed and MUST decode successfully. After apply, `/v1/models`, plan gating (`plan_types_for_model`), suppression (`is_suppressed_model`), and per-account service-tier routing on a non-leader MUST be identical to the leader. A non-leader refresh tick MUST NOT fetch the upstream catalog and SHALL instead reconcile from the persisted snapshot when the stored snapshot header differs from the last applied one (backstop for a lost invalidation bump). A leader catalog clear SHALL persist an explicit cleared marker and bump, so followers revert to the bootstrap floor rather than serving a withdrawn catalog. Every replica SHALL install its `model_registry` cache-invalidation callback (the global invalidation poller) before starting the model refresh scheduler, so a first leader tick that persists a changed snapshot cannot silently drop its bump. Every replica SHALL record the invalidation-poller version baseline before running its one-shot startup reconcile, so a leader bump that lands in the window between that reconcile's snapshot read and the poller's first background tick is delivered as an invalidation callback (within the poll bound) rather than absorbed as the poller's initial callback-less baseline (which would defer convergence to the non-leader scheduler backstop). The baseline-priming read SHALL surface a failure to its caller (the poller MUST remain uninitialized) rather than silently continuing, so a transient failure of the startup seed is logged and explicitly degraded to first-poll-baseline behavior instead of being mistaken for a recorded baseline — otherwise the first successful background poll would absorb a peer bump as its initial callback-less baseline and void the delivery guarantee priming exists to provide.

#### Scenario: Follower serves the refreshed catalog on /v1/models

- **GIVEN** replica A (leader) completes a registry refresh whose catalog adds a new slug and withdraws a bootstrap slug
- **AND** replica A persists the snapshot and bumps the `model_registry` namespace
- **WHEN** replica B's cache-invalidation poller observes the version change
- **THEN** replica B applies the snapshot to its in-memory registry
- **AND** `GET /v1/models` served by replica B lists the new slug and omits the withdrawn slug

#### Scenario: Follower enforces suppression of a withdrawn slug

- **GIVEN** the leader's refreshed snapshot marks a previously served slug as suppressed
- **WHEN** a follower applies the persisted snapshot
- **THEN** `is_suppressed_model` returns true for that slug on the follower

#### Scenario: Follower enforces plan gating for a newly gated slug

- **GIVEN** the leader's refreshed snapshot maps a slug to exactly one plan type
- **WHEN** a follower applies the persisted snapshot
- **THEN** `plan_types_for_model` on the follower returns exactly that plan set instead of no filtering

#### Scenario: Catalog clear propagates to followers

- **GIVEN** the leader clears the registry because no active accounts remain
- **WHEN** the leader persists the cleared marker and bumps, and a follower applies it
- **THEN** the follower reverts to the bootstrap catalog floor

#### Scenario: Lost bump converges via the refresh-tick backstop

- **GIVEN** a snapshot was persisted but the invalidation bump was lost
- **WHEN** a non-leader replica's next refresh tick runs
- **THEN** the replica detects the header mismatch, applies the persisted snapshot, and converges within one refresh interval

#### Scenario: Transient load failure in the callback is retried, not acknowledged

- **GIVEN** the leader persisted a changed snapshot and bumped the `model_registry` namespace
- **AND** a follower's snapshot load transiently fails on the invalidation callback (e.g. a DB read error or a momentarily unreadable payload)
- **WHEN** the follower's poll cycle runs the callback and it fails
- **THEN** the poller does not acknowledge the observed `model_registry` version and retries the callback on the next poll cycle
- **AND** once the transient failure clears, the retry applies the persisted snapshot within the poll bound without requiring a new leader bump

#### Scenario: Malformed set-backed field is rejected, not silently dropped

- **GIVEN** the leader bumped the `model_registry` namespace and the persisted payload is valid JSON but a set-backed field is wrong-typed (e.g. `model_plans` maps a slug to `{"gpt-x": "pro"}` instead of a list of plan slugs)
- **WHEN** a follower's invalidation callback loads and decodes the payload
- **THEN** the decode raises rather than dropping the offending entry
- **AND** the poller leaves the `model_registry` version unacknowledged and no partial catalog is applied (the follower keeps its prior in-memory state and retries on the next poll)

#### Scenario: Empty set-backed maps decode successfully

- **GIVEN** a persisted snapshot whose set-backed fields are genuinely empty (empty maps, or a slug mapped to an empty list)
- **WHEN** a replica decodes the payload
- **THEN** the decode succeeds and the corresponding sets are empty (empty is not treated as malformed)

#### Scenario: Applying a snapshot does not re-bump account_selection

- **GIVEN** the leader persisted a changed snapshot and bumped `model_registry`
- **WHEN** a follower applies the snapshot and invalidates its local account-selection cache
- **THEN** the follower does not enqueue or write an `account_selection` cache-invalidation bump

#### Scenario: Non-leader tick performs no upstream fetch

- **WHEN** a non-leader replica's refresh tick runs
- **THEN** it performs no upstream model-catalog fetch, regardless of whether it reconciled from the store

#### Scenario: First leader bump is not dropped at startup

- **GIVEN** a replica is starting up
- **WHEN** the model refresh scheduler starts
- **THEN** the global cache-invalidation poller with the `model_registry` callback is already installed, so an immediate leader persist-and-bump reaches followers within the poll bound

#### Scenario: Bump during the startup reconcile window is not dropped

- **GIVEN** a replica is starting up and has recorded the invalidation-poller version baseline
- **AND** a leader persists a changed snapshot and bumps the `model_registry` namespace in the window between the replica's one-shot startup reconcile and the poller's first background tick
- **WHEN** the poller's first background tick runs
- **THEN** it observes the version advanced past the recorded baseline and invokes the reconcile callback, so the replica applies the new snapshot within the poll bound rather than waiting for the non-leader scheduler backstop

#### Scenario: Reviving an expired unchanged snapshot bumps the bus

- **GIVEN** a snapshot was persisted with content hash H and its stored row then aged past `model_registry_snapshot_max_age_seconds`, so followers dropped to the bootstrap floor and reset their applied-content-hash marker
- **WHEN** the leader's next refresh succeeds with the same catalog bytes (content hash H again)
- **THEN** the leader advances `refreshed_at` without rewriting the payload but still bumps the `model_registry` namespace
- **AND** the followers observe the version change and re-apply the revived snapshot within the poll bound rather than waiting for the non-leader scheduler backstop

#### Scenario: Failed startup baseline prime is surfaced, not silently absorbed

- **GIVEN** a replica is starting up and the invalidation-poller baseline-priming read fails transiently
- **WHEN** the priming step runs
- **THEN** the poller remains uninitialized and the failure is surfaced (logged) rather than treated as a recorded baseline, degrading explicitly to first-poll-baseline behavior

### Requirement: Persisted model catalog survives restart and version skew

At startup every replica SHALL load the persisted model-registry snapshot into its in-memory registry before background schedulers start, provided the snapshot's age is within `model_registry_snapshot_max_age_seconds` (default 86400); an older snapshot SHALL be ignored so the bootstrap catalog remains the floor. A replica that still carries local registry state — whether an applied persisted snapshot or an unpublished leader-local refresh whose persist failed (no applied-snapshot marker) — SHALL drop it, reverting to the bootstrap floor and invalidating its local account-selection cache, when a reconcile observes that the only stored snapshot's age now exceeds the cap, so neither an expired catalog nor an unpublished one is served indefinitely while other replicas fall back to the floor. A snapshot whose `schema_version` differs from the running code's codec version SHALL be ignored with a warning and MUST NOT fail startup or the invalidation poller (rolling-deploy safety). A persist failure on the leader SHALL degrade to leader-local refresh behavior with a warning (the in-memory registry is still updated and persistence is retried next cycle) and SHALL reset the replica's applied-snapshot marker, so a later reconcile — for example after losing leadership — reloads the persisted snapshot instead of treating it as already applied. When a reconcile finds no persisted snapshot row at all while the replica still carries local registry state (an unpublished leader-local refresh whose persist failed, or an applied row deleted from the store), the replica SHALL drop that state — reverting to the bootstrap floor and invalidating its local account-selection cache — so it converges with the other replicas until a leader publishes a snapshot. When a leader refresh tick has active accounts but every upstream catalog fetch fails, the leader SHALL reconcile from the store on that tick — it made no change and did not advance the persisted `refreshed_at`, so under a prolonged upstream outage the leader SHALL drop to the bootstrap floor once the stored snapshot's age exceeds the staleness cap (matching the followers) instead of serving its now-stale in-memory catalog indefinitely; while the stored row is still fresh this reconcile SHALL be a no-op. Imported snapshots SHALL preserve refresh-TTL semantics by deriving the monotonic `fetched_at` from the persisted wall-clock `refreshed_at`.

#### Scenario: Restart loads the persisted catalog before the first refresh

- **GIVEN** a fresh persisted snapshot exists
- **WHEN** a replica starts
- **THEN** its registry serves the persisted catalog before the first refresh tick completes

#### Scenario: Snapshot older than the staleness cap is ignored

- **GIVEN** the persisted snapshot's `refreshed_at` is older than `model_registry_snapshot_max_age_seconds`
- **WHEN** a replica starts
- **THEN** the snapshot is not applied and the bootstrap catalog is served
- **AND** the next successful leader refresh repopulates the snapshot

#### Scenario: Mismatched schema version is ignored without error

- **GIVEN** the persisted snapshot's `schema_version` differs from the running code's codec version
- **WHEN** a replica attempts to load it at startup or via the poller
- **THEN** the snapshot is ignored with a warning and no error is raised

#### Scenario: Leader persist failure keeps the leader serving its refreshed catalog

- **GIVEN** the leader's registry refresh succeeded but persisting the snapshot fails
- **WHEN** the refresh cycle completes
- **THEN** the leader's in-memory registry still serves the refreshed catalog and a warning is logged
- **AND** the replica's applied-snapshot marker is reset so reconciliation no longer treats the store's row as already applied

#### Scenario: Former leader converges back to the persisted snapshot after a failed persist

- **GIVEN** a replica applied persisted snapshot hash H, then won leadership, refreshed its in-memory registry, and failed to persist the refreshed state
- **WHEN** the replica loses leadership and its next reconcile runs (poller callback or refresh-tick backstop)
- **THEN** it reloads the store's snapshot H and stops serving the unpublished catalog

#### Scenario: Unpublished catalog is dropped when the store is empty after leadership loss

- **GIVEN** the first-ever leader refresh updated a replica's in-memory registry but persisting the snapshot failed, so no `model_registry_snapshot` row exists
- **WHEN** the replica loses leadership and its next reconcile runs (poller callback or refresh-tick backstop)
- **THEN** it drops the unpublished catalog, reverts to the bootstrap floor, and invalidates its account-selection cache

#### Scenario: Applied snapshot is dropped once the store entry expires

- **GIVEN** a follower applied a persisted snapshot while it was fresh
- **AND** the leader stops advancing `refreshed_at` until the stored snapshot's age exceeds `model_registry_snapshot_max_age_seconds`
- **WHEN** the follower's next reconcile runs
- **THEN** the follower drops the applied snapshot, reverts to the bootstrap catalog floor, and invalidates its account-selection cache

#### Scenario: Leader drops the stale catalog when all fetches fail past the staleness cap

- **GIVEN** the leader applied a persisted snapshot while it was fresh
- **AND** every subsequent leader refresh tick has active accounts but all upstream catalog fetches fail, so the persisted `refreshed_at` is never advanced and its age exceeds `model_registry_snapshot_max_age_seconds`
- **WHEN** the leader's next refresh tick runs and again fails all fetches
- **THEN** the leader reconciles from the store, drops the stale in-memory snapshot, reverts to the bootstrap catalog floor, and invalidates its account-selection cache (converging with the followers)

#### Scenario: Leader keeps a fresh catalog when all fetches fail within the staleness cap

- **GIVEN** the leader applied a persisted snapshot that is still within `model_registry_snapshot_max_age_seconds`
- **WHEN** a leader refresh tick has active accounts but all upstream catalog fetches fail
- **THEN** the leader keeps serving the applied catalog (the reconcile is a no-op because its applied content hash already matches the store) and does not drop to the bootstrap floor

#### Scenario: Unpublished catalog is dropped when the only stored row is expired after leadership loss

- **GIVEN** a leader refresh updated a replica's in-memory registry but persisting the snapshot failed (no applied-snapshot marker)
- **AND** the only `model_registry_snapshot` row is a previously published snapshot whose age now exceeds `model_registry_snapshot_max_age_seconds`
- **WHEN** the replica loses leadership and its next reconcile runs (poller callback or refresh-tick backstop)
- **THEN** it drops the unpublished catalog, reverts to the bootstrap floor, and invalidates its account-selection cache

### Requirement: Every Codex-native catalog entry is wire-parseable

Every model entry returned by `GET /backend-api/codex/models` or the equivalent
`GET /v1/models?client_version=<version>` route MUST include the non-defaulted
Codex wire fields `truncation_policy` and `experimental_supported_tools`, even
when the entry comes from hidden retained bootstrap metadata or a persisted
legacy registry snapshot. When either field is absent from stored raw metadata,
the mapper MUST provide a conservative model-compatible default. Wire-valid
values provided by a live upstream catalog or model source MUST remain
authoritative and MUST NOT be overwritten by the compatibility defaults. When
`experimental_supported_tools` is not a list, the mapper MUST emit an empty
list. When it contains non-string members, the mapper MUST omit those members
rather than failing the complete catalog. A wire-valid `truncation_policy` MUST
use the `bytes` or `tokens` mode and a JSON integer representable by Codex's
signed 64-bit `limit` field. When an explicit policy does not satisfy that wire
shape, the mapper MUST emit the same conservative model-compatible policy used
when the field is absent.

#### Scenario: Hidden bootstrap metadata cannot invalidate the live catalog

- **GIVEN** a successful live refresh omits an older bundled model
- **AND** codex-lb retains that model as hidden metadata whose raw payload lacks
  required Codex wire fields
- **WHEN** a Codex client requests the native model catalog
- **THEN** the hidden entry includes a valid `truncation_policy`
- **AND** it includes `experimental_supported_tools` as a list
- **AND** the complete catalog can be deserialized instead of falling back to
  bundled client metadata

#### Scenario: Explicit valid upstream compatibility values win

- **GIVEN** a live catalog or model source provides `truncation_policy` or
  `experimental_supported_tools`
- **WHEN** codex-lb renders the Codex-native catalog entry
- **THEN** it preserves those explicit values unchanged

#### Scenario: Invalid source tool members cannot fail the catalog

- **GIVEN** a model source provides `experimental_supported_tools` with both
  string and non-string members
- **WHEN** codex-lb renders the Codex-native catalog entry
- **THEN** it retains the string tool names
- **AND** it omits non-string members instead of returning a server error

#### Scenario: Non-list source tool metadata cannot fail the catalog

- **GIVEN** a model source provides a non-list value for
  `experimental_supported_tools`
- **WHEN** codex-lb renders the Codex-native catalog entry
- **THEN** it emits an empty list instead of returning a server error

#### Scenario: Malformed source truncation policy cannot fail the catalog

- **GIVEN** a model source provides an invalid `truncation_policy`, such as a
  null, non-object, incomplete object, unknown mode, non-integer limit, or
  out-of-range limit
- **WHEN** codex-lb renders the Codex-native catalog entry
- **THEN** it emits the conservative model-compatible truncation policy
- **AND** it does not return a server error

#### Scenario: Client-version alias has the same complete contract

- **WHEN** Codex requests `GET /v1/models` with a non-empty `client_version`
- **THEN** every returned `models` entry satisfies the same required-field
  contract as `GET /backend-api/codex/models`

### Requirement: Fresh additional-quota evidence can establish account support

For a model canonically mapped to a separately metered additional quota, account selection MUST allow fresh account-specific additional-quota telemetry to establish model support when an authoritative general per-account model catalog omits that model. The system MUST continue to enforce registry plan and service-tier restrictions and MUST apply the existing additional-quota freshness, exhaustion, account-health, cooldown, capacity, security, and routing gates before selecting an account. When such a selected account is bound to an HTTP bridge session, every existing-session reuse entry point, including direct key lookup, previous-response alias fallback, and in-flight creation waiters, MUST enforce exact normalized model, canonical quota key, and normalized effective service-tier compatibility before returning the session. For a genuinely catalog-omitted account, reuse MUST re-evaluate current registry plan and requested service-tier plan eligibility without synchronously re-reading quota telemetry. This behavior MUST NOT apply to unknown models or to an unrelated additional-limit key supplied independently of the requested model.

#### Scenario: Fresh Spark quota overrides general account-catalog omission

- **GIVEN** an authoritative general account catalog omits `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` for a plan-compatible active account
- **AND** that account has fresh, non-exhausted `codex_spark` quota telemetry
- **WHEN** account selection is requested for `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`
- **THEN** the general account-catalog omission does not remove that account from consideration
- **AND** the account proceeds through the remaining additional-quota and routing gates

#### Scenario: Quota-admitted bridge session remains reusable

- **GIVEN** an account omitted from the authoritative general account catalog was selected for `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` using fresh, non-exhausted `codex_spark` telemetry
- **AND** an HTTP bridge session records that selection's normalized model, canonical quota key, and effective service tier
- **WHEN** a later turn requests the same normalized model, canonical quota mapping, and effective service tier
- **THEN** the existing bridge session remains reusable
- **AND** the synchronous reuse check does not re-read quota telemetry

#### Scenario: Bridge admission provenance is narrowly bound

- **GIVEN** an HTTP bridge session carries quota-backed catalog-omission provenance
- **WHEN** a later request reaches that session through direct key lookup, previous-response alias fallback, or an in-flight creation waiter with a different normalized model, canonical quota key, or effective service tier
- **THEN** that provenance does not bypass the normal catalog and service-tier checks
- **AND** a catalog-supported account rejected by the requested account-level service-tier index remains rejected

#### Scenario: Reuse rechecks current plan-tier eligibility for a catalog omission

- **GIVEN** an HTTP bridge session carries exact quota-backed catalog-omission provenance for a requested service tier
- **AND** the registry's current requested service-tier plan restrictions exclude the session account's current plan
- **WHEN** a later request reaches that session through any reuse entry point
- **THEN** the existing session is not returned under the recorded provenance
- **AND** the current request follows a request-scope fork or fail-closed path without synchronously re-reading quota telemetry or mutating the existing live session

#### Scenario: Incompatible request preserves another request's live bridge state

- **GIVEN** a live or in-flight HTTP bridge session is compatible with its creator request
- **AND** another direct, previous-response-alias, turn-state-alias, or in-flight-waiter request has mismatched quota-backed admission provenance or current plan-tier eligibility
- **WHEN** bridge request compatibility rejects that second request
- **THEN** an unanchored request uses an independent collision-resistant request-scope session, or an anchored request alone fails closed
- **AND** the creator's session remains registered, open, and unscheduled for close with its request model, service tier, and transport unchanged
- **AND** live previous-response and turn-state aliases remain unchanged so a subsequent compatible request can resolve and reuse the owner
- **AND** an alias mapping is removed only when its target is missing, closed, or inactive

#### Scenario: Forwarded prompt-cache mismatch forks on the receiving owner

- **GIVEN** two bridge replicas agree that a prompt-cache key belongs to one canonical owner
- **AND** that owner has an open quota-admitted Spark session whose effective service tier is incompatible with a priority request already forwarded to the owner
- **AND** the priority request's collision-resistant `internal_request_parallel` fork key rendezvous-hashes to the other replica
- **WHEN** compatibility rejects either the registered session or a session returned to an in-flight creation waiter
- **THEN** the receiving canonical owner creates and owns the request-local mismatch fork without forwarding again
- **AND** both requests can complete on independent transports while the creator session remains open and registered
- **AND** normal rendezvous ownership remains unchanged for canonical prompt-cache, session, turn-state, previous-response, and unforwarded fork keys

#### Scenario: Catalog-supported account-level service-tier exclusion remains authoritative

- **GIVEN** an authoritative general per-account catalog includes a mapped separately metered model for two plan-compatible accounts
- **AND** the authoritative requested service-tier account index includes only one of those accounts
- **AND** both accounts have fresh, non-exhausted additional-quota telemetry for the model
- **WHEN** account selection requests that model and service tier
- **THEN** the account absent from the requested service-tier account index is not selected
- **AND** quota evidence does not reclassify that catalog-supported account as model-catalog-omitted

#### Scenario: Plan incompatibility remains authoritative

- **GIVEN** a requested separately metered model is mapped to an additional quota
- **AND** an account's plan is excluded by the model registry's plan or requested service-tier restrictions
- **WHEN** account selection evaluates that account
- **THEN** the account is not selected even if additional-quota telemetry exists

#### Scenario: Missing or stale quota evidence fails closed

- **GIVEN** the general account catalog omits a mapped separately metered model
- **AND** no plan-compatible account has fresh additional-quota telemetry for that model
- **WHEN** account selection is requested
- **THEN** selection fails with the existing additional-quota data-unavailable behavior
- **AND** the system does not route based only on bootstrap metadata
- **AND** no quota-backed HTTP bridge session is admitted from that failed selection

#### Scenario: Explicit unrelated quota cannot bypass model support

- **GIVEN** a caller supplies an additional-limit key that is not the requested model's canonical quota mapping
- **WHEN** the general per-account catalog excludes an account for that model
- **THEN** the supplied quota key does not override the account-catalog exclusion

### Requirement: Model catalog reservations are released on every exit path

The model catalog builders for `GET /v1/models` and `GET /backend-api/codex/models` SHALL release the API-key usage reservation after acquisition on normal return, exception, or cancellation. The builders MUST preserve the existing reservation amount and successful response shape.

#### Scenario: OpenAI-compatible catalog lookup fails

- **WHEN** `_list_enabled_source_catalog_models` raises after reservation
  acquisition while serving `GET /v1/models`
- **THEN** the reservation row is released
- **AND** its reserved usage is no longer charged to the key

#### Scenario: Codex-native catalog lookup fails

- **WHEN** `_list_enabled_source_catalog_models` raises after reservation
  acquisition while serving `GET /backend-api/codex/models`
- **THEN** the reservation row is released
- **AND** its reserved usage is no longer charged to the key

#### Scenario: Catalog request is cancelled

- **WHEN** either model catalog builder is cancelled after reservation
  acquisition
- **THEN** the reservation is released before cancellation propagates

### Requirement: Ultrafast routing follows live account entitlement

The system MUST treat `ultrafast` as an access-controlled service tier and MUST derive account eligibility from live or retained per-account upstream catalog metadata. The bundled bootstrap catalog MUST NOT invent Ultrafast entitlement.

#### Scenario: Only an advertising account is eligible

- **GIVEN** two accounts advertise `gpt-5.6-sol`
- **AND** only one account advertises the `ultrafast` service tier
- **WHEN** a request explicitly asks for `service_tier: "ultrafast"`
- **THEN** account selection considers only the advertising account

#### Scenario: Bootstrap metadata does not grant preview access

- **WHEN** no live or retained account catalog advertises `ultrafast`
- **THEN** bootstrap model metadata does not expose or grant that tier
