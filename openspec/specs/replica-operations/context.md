# replica-operations Context

## Purpose

codex-lb ships first-class multi-replica machinery — the HTTP bridge instance ring with owner
forwarding, DB-backed leader election, the cache-invalidation bus, DB-backed sticky sessions and
rate limiting — but the prerequisites for actually running more than one replica were scattered
across code comments and the Helm README. The adjacent [specification](spec.md) is the normative
topology contract; this context explains what an operator must provision, which failure modes are
guarded at startup, and which cross-replica behaviors are best-effort.

## Topology overview

A supported multi-replica deployment looks like:

- **Shared PostgreSQL** (`CODEX_LB_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://...`) — every cross-replica
  coordination primitive lives in this database: `scheduler_leader` (leader lease),
  `bridge_ring_members` (ring membership + advertise endpoints), `http_bridge_sessions`
  (bridge session ownership), `cache_invalidation` (settings/selection cache bus),
  `sticky_sessions`, `rate_limit_attempts`, and `runtime_sentinels` (startup consistency
  sentinels such as the encryption-key fingerprint).
- **Leader election at its default** — `CODEX_LB_LEADER_ELECTION_ENABLED` defaults to `true`, so
  shared-database replicas arbitrate one leader without extra configuration. Explicitly setting it
  to `false` is a single-instance escape hatch: every replica self-elects and singleton schedulers
  (usage refresh, automations, retention, quota planner, api-key reset, sticky-session cleanup,
  auth guardian) can run N-fold. The auth guardian self-disables in that configuration and logs a
  startup WARNING.
- **Bridge ring identity** — a unique `CODEX_LB_HTTP_RESPONSES_SESSION_BRIDGE_INSTANCE_ID` per
  replica and a reachable replica-specific advertise URL so hard-continuity requests landing on
  the wrong replica can be forwarded to the owner (see `sticky-session-operations` and
  `responses-api-compat` for the forwarding mechanics). Live membership and advertise endpoints
  are registered and discovered through the shared database. In the normal runtime that live,
  endpoint-bearing database set determines routing; `..._INSTANCE_RING` does not override or
  restrict it. The static list remains a legacy fallback for internal/test paths constructed
  without a membership reader and a configuration hint for multi-replica validation. Empty live
  discovery uses only the current instance, and lookup failures fail closed rather than falling
  back to the static list.
- **Shared encryption key** — the same `encryption.key` file mounted on every replica. Verified
  at startup against the `runtime_sentinels` fingerprint (below).

SQLite remains fully supported for exactly one application process. The leader lease is
database-arbitrated on SQLite through the same conditional lease update used for PostgreSQL; it
is not bypassed. Multi-process SQLite is still unsupported because concurrent writers risk
`database is locked` failures and network filesystems add corruption risk. Do not use
`uvicorn --workers N` or share one SQLite file between containers; scaling out means moving to
PostgreSQL.

## Why the encryption-key fingerprint sentinel

Divergent encryption keys do not fail at startup; they fail replica-dependently at use time:
dashboard session cookies minted by one replica 401 on another, encrypted proxy credentials and
OAuth tokens fail to decrypt, and bridge owner-forwarding HMAC signatures are rejected with
`bridge_forward_invalid`. The sentinel turns that class of misconfiguration into a deterministic
startup failure. `sha256` over the raw key bytes is exact (the key file *is* the key), and the
insert-if-absent stamp needs no advisory lock: PostgreSQL primary-key uniqueness arbitrates the
concurrent first boot, and SQLite's single-writer lock makes insert-or-noop atomic.

### Runbook: intentional key rotation

1. Stop all replicas.
2. Replace the mounted `encryption.key` on every replica (re-encrypt stored secrets as needed).
3. Delete the stale sentinel: `DELETE FROM runtime_sentinels WHERE name = 'encryption_key_fingerprint';`
4. Start the replicas; the first one stamps the new fingerprint.

Escape hatches: `CODEX_LB_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FINGERPRINT_MODE=warn` (log ERROR, continue) or `off`.
Leave it at `enforce` in production — a warn-mode mismatch means some fraction of logins and
bridge forwards are already failing.

## Settings optimistic locking

`PUT /api/settings` is a full-row read-modify-write over ~40 fields. Before versioning, two
concurrent saves (two dashboard tabs, or two replicas' dashboards) silently lost the first
writer's fields — including security toggles — with the audit log recording only the winner's
diff. `dashboard_settings.version` now rides every ORM update (`WHERE id = 1 AND version = :old`),
so the loser gets `409 settings_conflict` and nothing is partially applied. Clients may send
`expectedVersion` (from a previous GET/PUT response) to also detect staleness that predates the
request; the dashboard frontend does not send it yet (follow-up), so server-side race protection
is what is guaranteed today. Internal single-field writers (password, TOTP, guest password)
retry once on conflict because their mutations are idempotent absolute writes.

## Metrics semantics

- **One replica, multiple workers**: without `PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR`, each worker owns a
  private registry and only the worker that wins the metrics-port bind serves `/metrics` — i.e.
  roughly 1/N of traffic. The losing workers now log an ERROR naming the remediation. Set
  `PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR` to a writable directory shared by the workers to aggregate.
- **Multiple replicas**: counters are per-replica by design. Scrape every replica individually
  (per-pod scrape targets / ServiceMonitor); scraping through a load-balanced VIP samples a
  random replica per scrape and is unsupported.

## Graceful shutdown drain

Pod termination closes application admission before Uvicorn closes HTTP or WebSocket connections.
Helm preStop starts the process drain, drops readiness, waits through the routing dwell, and then
returns when tracked work reaches zero or the shared application deadline expires. A direct
SIGTERM establishes the same barrier when preStop is absent. New WebSocket scopes are rejected;
admitted Responses sockets close promptly when idle and remain tracked through terminal delivery,
request-log persistence ownership, and API-key settlement ownership while the bounded budget
remains. Once the deadline expires, shutdown proceeds rather than extending the drain; work still
blocked at that point can be cut off, so operators should size the timeout for expected turn
latency.

With the defaults, preStop starts a 30-second application deadline and waits at least the
15-second routing dwell measured from Python helper start; local drain-start request latency
consumes that same absolute budget. If `in_flight` is already zero when dwell ends, SIGTERM reuses
the roughly 15 seconds remaining instead of granting another 30-second drain period. Kubelet's
hard termination grace starts before the helper process, so exec/Python launch latency consumes
only that hard grace and remains outside the application deadline. The chart requires
`terminationGracePeriodSeconds` to cover the application timeout plus a two-second failed
preStop-start fallback and a fixed 30-second post-drain reserve. The launcher stops awaiting
Uvicorn connection and lifespan cleanup 25 seconds after the shared application deadline, leaving
five additional seconds after helper start for captured-signal delivery and ordinary process exit.
If cleanup ignores cancellation, the launcher forces that captured signal, or SIGTERM for a
programmatic shutdown, instead of returning an unbounded task to asyncio runner teardown. The
65-second default adds three seconds of launch headroom above the enforced minimum.

## Known limitations (triaged follow-ups)

- **Concurrent cross-replica usage refresh can transiently tear `additional_usage_history`** —
  the per-account delete+insert rewrite is non-transactional across refreshers; the tear
  self-heals within one refresh interval. Documented limitation; no follow-up scheduled.
- **Invalidation-bus failure is non-fatal** — normal cross-replica mutations use the shipped
  invalidation bus. If a bump or poll fails, the mutation still succeeds and each affected cache
  follows its documented fallback behavior. See `query-caching` for namespaces, timing, failure
  metrics, and cache-specific backstops.
