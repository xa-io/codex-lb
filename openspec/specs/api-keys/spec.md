# api-keys Specification

## Purpose

Define API key lifecycle, enforcement, accounting, and dashboard management contracts for downstream clients.
## Requirements
### Requirement: API Key creation

The system SHALL allow the admin to create API keys via `POST /api/api-keys` with a `name` (required), `allowed_models` (optional list), `weekly_token_limit` (optional integer), `expires_at` (optional ISO 8601 datetime), `assigned_account_ids` (optional list), and `usage_sections` (optional comma-separated string, defaults to `"upstream_limits,account_pool_usage"`). The system MUST generate a key in the format `sk-clb-{48 hex chars}`, store only the `sha256` hash in the database, and return the plain key exactly once in the creation response. The system MUST accept timezone-aware ISO 8601 datetimes for `expiresAt`, normalize them to UTC naive for persistence, and return the expiration as UTC in API responses.

When `assigned_account_ids` is omitted or empty, the created key SHALL remain unscoped and apply to all accounts. When `assigned_account_ids` is provided with one or more valid account IDs, the created key SHALL enable account-assignment scope and persist those assignments.

#### Scenario: Create unscoped key without assigned accounts

- **WHEN** admin submits `POST /api/api-keys` without `assignedAccountIds`
- **THEN** the created key returns `accountAssignmentScopeEnabled = false`
- **AND** `assignedAccountIds = []`

#### Scenario: Create scoped key with assigned accounts

- **WHEN** admin submits `POST /api/api-keys` with `assignedAccountIds` containing valid account IDs
- **THEN** the created key returns `accountAssignmentScopeEnabled = true`
- **AND** `assignedAccountIds` matches the supplied accounts

#### Scenario: Reject unknown assigned account IDs on create

- **WHEN** admin submits `POST /api/api-keys` with an unknown account ID in `assignedAccountIds`
- **THEN** the system returns 400

#### Scenario: Create key and show plain key

- **WHEN** admin submits `POST /api/api-keys` with a valid payload
- **THEN** the response contains the full plain key exactly once and the system never returns the plain key on subsequent reads

#### Scenario: Create key with timezone-aware expiration

- **WHEN** admin submits `POST /api/api-keys` with `{ "name": "dev-key", "expiresAt": "2025-12-31T00:00:00Z" }`
- **THEN** the system persists the expiration successfully without PostgreSQL datetime binding errors
- **AND** the response returns `expiresAt` representing the same UTC instant

### Requirement: API Key update
The system SHALL allow updating key properties via `PATCH /api/api-keys/{id}`. Updatable fields: `name`, `allowedModels`, `weeklyTokenLimit`, `expiresAt`, `isActive`, `usageSections`, `transportPolicyOverride`. The key hash and prefix MUST NOT be modifiable. The system MUST accept timezone-aware ISO 8601 datetimes for `expiresAt` and normalize them to UTC naive before persistence. The `transportPolicyOverride` field MUST accept `null` (follow the global policy) or one of `"smart"`, `"always_http"`, `"always_websocket"`; any other value MUST be rejected with HTTP 400.

When a submitted API key limit rule does not match an existing rule by `limit_type`, `limit_window`, and `model_filter`, the system MUST initialize the new rule's `current_value` from the API key's successful existing request-log usage in that rule's current window. If `resetUsage` is true, the system MUST initialize submitted limits with `current_value: 0`.

#### Scenario: Update key with timezone-aware expiration
- **WHEN** admin submits `PATCH /api/api-keys/{id}` with `{ "expiresAt": "2025-12-31T00:00:00Z" }`
- **THEN** the system persists the expiration successfully without PostgreSQL datetime binding errors
- **AND** the response returns `expiresAt` representing the same UTC instant

#### Scenario: Update non-existent key

- **WHEN** admin submits `PATCH /api/api-keys/{id}` with an unknown ID
- **THEN** the system returns 404

#### Scenario: Add token limit after current-window usage exists

- **WHEN** an API key has successful request-log token usage in the active daily window
- **AND** the API key has error or incomplete request-log token usage in the same window
- **AND** admin submits `PATCH /api/api-keys/{id}` adding a daily `total_tokens` limit without `resetUsage`
- **THEN** the new limit's `current_value` includes only the successful current-window token usage

#### Scenario: Add cost limit after current-window usage exists

- **WHEN** an API key has successful request-log costs in the active daily window
- **AND** admin submits `PATCH /api/api-keys/{id}` adding a daily `cost_usd` limit without `resetUsage`
- **THEN** the new limit's `current_value` is the sum of each successful request log's `cost_usd` converted to truncated integer microdollars

#### Scenario: Reset usage when adding a limit

- **WHEN** an API key has request-log usage in the active window
- **AND** admin submits `PATCH /api/api-keys/{id}` adding a limit with `resetUsage: true`
- **THEN** the new limit's `current_value` is `0`

#### Scenario: Update key transport policy override

- **WHEN** admin submits `PATCH /api/api-keys/{id}` with `{ "transportPolicyOverride": "always_http" }`
- **THEN** the system persists the override and returns `transportPolicyOverride = "always_http"`

#### Scenario: Clear key transport policy override

- **WHEN** admin submits `PATCH /api/api-keys/{id}` with `{ "transportPolicyOverride": null }`
- **THEN** the system clears the override and the key follows the global `http_downstream_transport_policy`

#### Scenario: Reject invalid transport policy override

- **WHEN** admin submits `PATCH /api/api-keys/{id}` with `{ "transportPolicyOverride": "carrier-pigeon" }`
- **THEN** the system returns 400 and does not modify the key

### Requirement: API Key deletion

The system SHALL allow deleting an API key via `DELETE /api/api-keys/{id}`. Deletion MUST be permanent and the key MUST immediately stop authenticating.

#### Scenario: Delete existing key

- **WHEN** admin calls `DELETE /api/api-keys/{id}` for an existing key
- **THEN** the key is permanently removed from the database and returns 204

#### Scenario: Delete non-existent key

- **WHEN** admin calls `DELETE /api/api-keys/{id}` with an unknown ID
- **THEN** the system returns 404

### Requirement: API Key regeneration

The system SHALL allow regenerating an API key via `POST /api/api-keys/{id}/regenerate`. This MUST generate a new key value (new hash, new prefix) while preserving all other properties (name, models, limits, expiration). The new plain key MUST be returned exactly once.

#### Scenario: Regenerate key

- **WHEN** admin calls `POST /api/api-keys/{id}/regenerate`
- **THEN** the system returns the updated key object with a new `key` and `keyPrefix`; the old key immediately stops authenticating

### Requirement: API Key authentication global switch
The system SHALL provide an `api_key_auth_enabled` boolean in `DashboardSettings`. When false (default), local requests to protected proxy routes MAY proceed without an API key. Operators MAY additionally opt specific non-local proxy clients into unauthenticated access by configuring `proxy_unauthenticated_client_cidrs`. Requests that are neither local nor explicitly allowlisted MUST be rejected until proxy authentication is configured. When true, protected proxy routes require a valid API key in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer authentication scheme.

#### Scenario: Enable API key auth

- **WHEN** admin submits `PUT /api/settings` with `{ "apiKeyAuthEnabled": true }`
- **THEN** subsequent proxy requests without a valid Bearer token are rejected with 401

#### Scenario: Disable API key auth for a local request

- **WHEN** admin submits `PUT /api/settings` with `{ "apiKeyAuthEnabled": false }`
- **AND** a local client calls a protected proxy route
- **THEN** the request is allowed without API key authentication

#### Scenario: Disable API key auth for a non-local request

- **WHEN** admin submits `PUT /api/settings` with `{ "apiKeyAuthEnabled": false }`
- **AND** a non-local client calls a protected proxy route
- **THEN** the request is rejected with 401 until proxy authentication is configured

#### Scenario: Disable API key auth for an explicitly allowlisted proxy client
- **WHEN** admin submits `PUT /api/settings` with `{ "apiKeyAuthEnabled": false }`
- **AND** the request socket peer IP belongs to configured `proxy_unauthenticated_client_cidrs`
- **THEN** the protected proxy route proceeds without API key authentication

#### Scenario: Disable API key auth for a non-local request outside the explicit allowlist
- **WHEN** admin submits `PUT /api/settings` with `{ "apiKeyAuthEnabled": false }`
- **AND** a non-local client calls a protected proxy route
- **AND** the request socket peer IP is outside configured `proxy_unauthenticated_client_cidrs`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with 401 until proxy authentication is configured

#### Scenario: Enable without any keys created

- **WHEN** admin enables API key auth but no keys exist
- **THEN** all proxy requests are rejected with 401 (the system SHALL NOT prevent enabling even if no keys exist)

#### Scenario: Toggle API key auth

- **WHEN** admin toggles `apiKeyAuthEnabled` in settings
- **THEN** the system calls `PUT /api/settings` and reflects the new state

### Requirement: API Key Bearer authentication guard
The system SHALL validate API keys on protected proxy routes (`/v1/*`, `/backend-api/codex/*`, `/backend-api/transcribe`) when `api_key_auth_enabled` is true. Validation MUST be implemented as a router-level `Security` dependency, not ASGI middleware. The dependency MUST compute `sha256` of the Bearer token and look up the hash in the `api_keys` table.

The dependency SHALL return a typed `ApiKeyData` value directly to the route handler. Route handlers MUST NOT access API key data via `request.state`.

`/api/codex/usage` SHALL NOT be covered by the API key auth guard scope.

The dependency SHALL raise a domain exception on validation failure. The exception handler SHALL format the response using the OpenAI error envelope.

#### Scenario: Disabled auth allowlist uses raw socket peer only
- **WHEN** `api_key_auth_enabled` is false
- **AND** forwarded headers claim a different client IP
- **AND** the request socket peer IP is outside configured `proxy_unauthenticated_client_cidrs`
- **THEN** the dependency rejects the request with 401
- **AND** forwarded headers do not satisfy the explicit allowlist

#### Scenario: API key guard route scope

- **WHEN** `api_key_auth_enabled` is true and a request is made to `/v1/responses`, `/backend-api/codex/responses`, `/v1/audio/transcriptions`, or `/backend-api/transcribe`
- **THEN** the API key guard validation is applied

#### Scenario: Codex usage excluded from API key guard scope

- **WHEN** `api_key_auth_enabled` is true and a request is made to `/api/codex/usage`
- **THEN** API key guard validation is not applied

#### Scenario: Valid API key injected into handler

- **WHEN** `api_key_auth_enabled` is true and a valid Bearer token is provided
- **THEN** the route handler receives a typed `ApiKeyData` parameter (not `request.state`)

#### Scenario: API key auth disabled returns None for local requests

- **WHEN** `api_key_auth_enabled` is false
- **AND** the request is classified as local
- **THEN** the dependency returns `None` and the request proceeds without authentication

#### Scenario: API key auth disabled rejects non-local requests

- **WHEN** `api_key_auth_enabled` is false
- **AND** the request is classified as non-local
- **AND** the request socket peer IP is outside configured `proxy_unauthenticated_client_cidrs`
- **THEN** the dependency rejects the request with 401

### Requirement: Proxy identity cannot bypass disabled API-key auth

When API-key authentication is disabled, protected HTTP and WebSocket routes MUST use raw-peer-backed locality consensus. Any `proxy_unauthenticated_client_cidrs` exception MUST evaluate only the launcher-preserved raw socket peer and MUST fail closed when that peer is unavailable. A projected client identity MUST NOT satisfy the socket allowlist.

#### Scenario: Agreeing identities retain local access

- **WHEN** a trusted raw peer sends populated identity families that all resolve to loopback
- **AND** the request otherwise satisfies local-request rules
- **THEN** `/v1/models` and `/v1/responses` may proceed without an API key

#### Scenario: Conflict cannot authorize HTTP or WebSocket

- **WHEN** populated identity families resolve differently or one cannot be resolved
- **AND** the raw peer is outside `proxy_unauthenticated_client_cidrs`
- **THEN** `/v1/models` is rejected with HTTP 401
- **AND** `/v1/responses` WebSocket is rejected with HTTP 401 before upgrade

#### Scenario: Projected allowlist identity is rejected

- **WHEN** the projected client belongs to `proxy_unauthenticated_client_cidrs` but the preserved raw peer does not
- **THEN** the protected route is rejected with HTTP 401

### Requirement: Model restriction enforcement

The system SHALL enforce per-key model restrictions in the proxy service layer (not middleware). When `allowed_models` is set (non-null, non-empty) and the requested model is not in the list, the system MUST reject the request. When reading stored `allowed_models`, JSON `null`, blank strings, and non-string array entries MUST be ignored and MUST NOT become model names. The `/v1/models` endpoint MUST filter the model list based on the authenticated key's `allowed_models`.

#### Scenario: Stored null allowed-model entries are ignored

- **GIVEN** an API key row stores `allowed_models` as `[null, "gpt-5.2", 42, ""]`
- **WHEN** the key policy is loaded
- **THEN** the effective allowed model list is `["gpt-5.2"]`
- **AND** `null` is not converted to `"None"`

### Requirement: Weekly token usage tracking
The system SHALL atomically increment `weekly_tokens_used` on the API key record when a non-warmup proxy request completes with token usage data. The token count MUST be `input_tokens + output_tokens`. If token usage is unavailable (error response), the counter MUST NOT be incremented.

#### Scenario: Successful request with usage

- **WHEN** a non-warmup proxy request completes with `input_tokens: 100, output_tokens: 50` for an authenticated key
- **THEN** `weekly_tokens_used` is atomically incremented by 150

#### Scenario: Request with no usage data

- **WHEN** a non-warmup proxy request fails with an error and no usage data is returned
- **THEN** `weekly_tokens_used` is not incremented

#### Scenario: Request without API key auth

- **WHEN** `api_key_auth_enabled` is false and a non-warmup proxy request completes
- **THEN** no API key usage tracking occurs

#### Scenario: Warmup request is excluded from weekly usage tracking

- **WHEN** an authenticated `POST /v1/warmup` execution writes request log rows
- **THEN** those warmup rows are excluded from API key weekly token usage increments

### Requirement: Weekly token usage reset

The system SHALL keep the existing lazy on-read reset strategy for API key usage limits. When validating an API key, if a limit `reset_at < now()`, the system MUST reset the counter and advance `reset_at` by whole window intervals until it is in the future. The system MUST also run an hourly background fallback sweep that repairs expired API key limit usage even when no validation request arrives.

#### Scenario: Weekly reset triggered on validation

- **WHEN** an API key is validated and `weekly_reset_at` is 2 weeks in the past
- **THEN** `weekly_tokens_used` is set to 0 and `weekly_reset_at` is advanced by 14 days (2 × 7 days) to a future date

#### Scenario: No reset needed

- **WHEN** an API key is validated and `weekly_reset_at` is in the future
- **THEN** no reset occurs; `weekly_tokens_used` retains its current value

#### Scenario: Hourly fallback resets expired usage without a read

- **WHEN** an API key usage limit is expired and no validation request occurs
- **THEN** the hourly background fallback resets `current_value` to 0 and advances `reset_at` into the future

### Requirement: RequestLog API key reference

The system SHALL record the `api_key_id` in the `request_logs` table for proxy
requests authenticated with an API key. The field MUST be NULL when API key
auth is disabled or the request is unauthenticated. This applies to error rows
as well as successes: when a shared upstream session (e.g. an HTTP-bridge
session multiplexing requests from multiple API keys) fails its pending
requests, each request's log row MUST be attributed to that request's own
authenticated key.

#### Scenario: Authenticated request logged

- **WHEN** a proxy request is authenticated with API key `key-123` and completes
- **THEN** the `request_logs` entry has `api_key_id = "key-123"`

#### Scenario: Unauthenticated request logged

- **WHEN** API key auth is disabled and a proxy request completes
- **THEN** the `request_logs` entry has `api_key_id = NULL`

#### Scenario: Bridge failure fan-out preserves per-request key attribution

- **GIVEN** an HTTP-bridge session holds a pending request authenticated with
  API key `key-123`
- **WHEN** the session fails its pending requests (upstream close, send
  failure, request timeout, or local terminal error)
- **THEN** the request's `request_logs` error entry has
  `api_key_id = "key-123"` even though the session-level failure path has no
  single key of its own

### Requirement: Frontend API Key management

The SPA settings page SHALL include an API Key management section with: a toggle for `apiKeyAuthEnabled`, a key list table showing prefix/name/models/limit/usage/expiry/status, a create dialog (name, model selection, assigned-account selection, usage sections multi-select, weekly limit, expiry date), and key actions (edit, delete, regenerate). On key creation, the SPA MUST display the plain key in a copy-able dialog with a warning that it will not be shown again, and the copy action MUST remain functional in secure and non-secure contexts.

The create and edit dialogs SHALL expose an `Apply to codex /model` checkbox directly below `Allowed models`. The checkbox SHALL default to unchecked for new keys and SHALL edit the stored API key value for existing keys.

#### Scenario: Create key with optional account scoping

- **WHEN** an admin opens the create API key dialog
- **THEN** the dialog shows the Assigned accounts picker
- **AND** leaving the picker at `All accounts` creates an unscoped key
- **AND** selecting one or more accounts creates a scoped key for only those accounts

#### Scenario: Create key with usage sections multi-select

- **WHEN** an admin opens the create API key dialog
- **THEN** the dialog shows a "Usage sections shown to client" multi-select dropdown below the Assigned accounts picker
- **AND** the dropdown includes "Upstream limits" and "Account pool usage" options
- **AND** by default both options are selected

#### Scenario: Create key and show plain key

- **WHEN** admin creates a key via the UI
- **THEN** a dialog shows the full plain key with a copy button and a warning message

#### Scenario: API key dialog copy fallback

- **WHEN** a user clicks Copy for the created API key inside the dialog
- **THEN** the copy operation succeeds using secure Clipboard API when available
- **AND** falls back to dialog-scoped `execCommand("copy")` when secure Clipboard API is unavailable

#### Scenario: Create key with codex model visibility option
- **WHEN** an admin opens the create API key dialog
- **THEN** the `Apply to codex /model` checkbox appears directly below `Allowed models`
- **AND** it is unchecked by default

#### Scenario: Edit key with stored codex model visibility option
- **WHEN** an admin opens the edit API key dialog for a key with `apply_to_codex_model: true`
- **THEN** the `Apply to codex /model` checkbox is shown as checked

### Requirement: Cost accounting uses model and service-tier pricing
When computing API key `cost_usd` usage, the system MUST price requests using the resolved model pricing and the authoritative `service_tier` reported by the upstream response when available, falling back to the forwarded request `service_tier` only when the response omits it. Requests sent with non-standard service tiers MUST use the published pricing for the tier actually used instead of falling back to standard-tier pricing.

#### Scenario: Priority-tier request increments cost limit
- **WHEN** an authenticated request for a priced model is finalized with `service_tier: "priority"`
- **THEN** the system computes `cost_usd` using the priority-tier rate for that model

#### Scenario: Flex-tier request increments cost limit
- **WHEN** an authenticated request for a priced model is finalized with `service_tier: "flex"`
- **THEN** the system computes `cost_usd` using the flex-tier rate for that model

#### Scenario: Standard-tier request keeps standard pricing
- **WHEN** an authenticated request for the same model is finalized without `service_tier`
- **THEN** the system computes `cost_usd` using the standard-tier rate

### Requirement: gpt-5.4 pricing is recognized
The system MUST recognize `gpt-5.4` pricing when computing request costs. For standard-tier requests with more than 272K input tokens, the system MUST apply the published higher long-context rates.

#### Scenario: gpt-5.4 request priced at standard tier
- **WHEN** a request for `gpt-5.4` completes with standard service tier
- **THEN** the system computes non-zero cost using the configured `gpt-5.4` standard rates

#### Scenario: gpt-5.4 long-context request priced at long-context rates
- **WHEN** a standard-tier `gpt-5.4` request completes with more than 272K input tokens
- **THEN** the system computes cost using the configured long-context `gpt-5.4` rates

### Requirement: Model-scoped limit enforcement

The system SHALL separate authentication validation from quota enforcement. `validate_key()` in the auth guard SHALL only verify key validity (existence, active status, expiry, basic reset). Quota enforcement SHALL occur at a point where the request model is known.

Limit applicability rules:
- `limit.model_filter is None` → always applies (global limit)
- `limit.model_filter == request_model` → applies (model-scoped limit)
- otherwise → does not apply for this request

For model-less requests (e.g., `/v1/models`), only global limits SHALL be evaluated.

The service contract SHALL be typed explicitly: `enforce_limits_for_request(key_id: str, *, request_model: str | None, request_service_tier: str | None = None) -> None`.

#### Scenario: Model-scoped limit does not block other models

- **WHEN** `model_filter="gpt-5.1"` limit is exhausted
- **AND** request model is `gpt-4o-mini`
- **THEN** the request is allowed

#### Scenario: Model-scoped limit blocks matching model

- **WHEN** `model_filter="gpt-5.1"` limit is exhausted
- **AND** request model is `gpt-5.1`
- **THEN** the request returns 429

#### Scenario: Model-scoped limit does not block model-less endpoints

- **WHEN** `model_filter="gpt-5.1"` limit is exhausted
- **AND** request is to `/v1/models` (no model context)
- **THEN** the request is allowed

#### Scenario: Global limit blocks all proxy requests

- **WHEN** a global limit (no `model_filter`) is exhausted
- **THEN** all proxy requests return 429

### Requirement: Limit update with usage state preservation
When updating API key limits, the system SHALL preserve existing usage state (`current_value`, `reset_at`) for unchanged limit rules. Limit comparison key is `(limit_type, limit_window, model_filter)`.

- Matching existing rule: `current_value` and `reset_at` SHALL be preserved; only `max_value` is updated
- New rule (no match) without `resetUsage`: `current_value` SHALL be initialized from the API key's successful existing request-log usage in the new rule's current window, with a fresh `reset_at`
- New rule (no match) with `resetUsage`: `current_value=0` and fresh `reset_at`
- Removed rule (in existing but not in update): row is deleted

Usage reset SHALL only occur via an explicit action (`resetUsage` field or dedicated endpoint), never as a side-effect of metadata or policy edits.

#### Scenario: Metadata-only edit preserves usage state

- **WHEN** an API key PATCH updates only name or is_active
- **AND** `limits` field is not included in the payload
- **THEN** existing `current_value` and `reset_at` are unchanged

#### Scenario: Same policy re-submission preserves usage state

- **WHEN** an API key PATCH includes `limits` with identical rules (same type/window/filter/max_value)
- **THEN** existing `current_value` and `reset_at` are unchanged

#### Scenario: max_value adjustment preserves counters

- **WHEN** an API key PATCH changes only `max_value` for an existing matched limit rule
- **THEN** that rule's existing `current_value` and `reset_at` are unchanged

#### Scenario: Adding a new limit backfills current-window usage

- **WHEN** an API key has successful request-log usage in the active window
- **AND** an API key PATCH adds a limit rule that does not match any existing rule
- **AND** `resetUsage` is not true
- **THEN** the new rule's `current_value` reflects successful existing request-log usage for that rule's current window
- **AND** the new rule receives a fresh `reset_at`

#### Scenario: resetUsage keeps new limits at zero

- **WHEN** an API key has request-log usage in the active window
- **AND** an API key PATCH adds a limit rule that does not match any existing rule
- **AND** `resetUsage` is true
- **THEN** the new rule's `current_value` is `0`
- **AND** the new rule receives a fresh `reset_at`

### Requirement: API key edit payload — conditional limits transmission

The frontend API key edit dialog SHALL transmit `limits` in the PATCH payload only when limit values have actually changed. The system SHALL normalize and compare initial and current limit values to detect changes.

- Metadata-only changes (name, is_active): `limits` field MUST be omitted from the payload
- Identical rule sets with different ordering: MUST be treated as unchanged (`limits` omitted)

Backend contract:
- `limits` absent in payload: limit policy unchanged (usage/reset state preserved)
- `limits` present in payload: policy replacement (state-preserving upsert applied)

#### Scenario: Name-only edit omits limits from payload

- **WHEN** only the API key name is modified in the edit dialog
- **THEN** the PATCH payload does not include the `limits` field

#### Scenario: Reordered identical rules treated as unchanged

- **WHEN** the same limit rules are submitted in a different order
- **THEN** the system treats this as unchanged and omits `limits` from the payload

### Requirement: Public OpenAI-compatible model list filtering

OpenAI-compatible model list endpoints SHALL filter models using a single predicate that requires both conditions:
1. `model.supported_in_api` is true
2. If `allowed_models` is configured, the model is in the allowed set

This predicate SHALL be applied consistently across `/api/models`, `/v1/models`, and the OpenAI-style `data` alias in `/backend-api/codex/models`. The Codex-native `models` catalog in `/backend-api/codex/models` SHALL also expose unsupported upstream models only when the model is a Codex shell-command model (`shell_type="shell_command"`); unsupported non-shell models SHALL remain hidden.

#### Scenario: Unsupported model excluded from /v1/models

- **WHEN** a model snapshot contains a model with `supported_in_api=false`
- **THEN** that model is not included in the `/v1/models` response

#### Scenario: Unsupported non-shell model excluded from /backend-api/codex/models

- **WHEN** a model snapshot contains a model with `supported_in_api=false`
- **AND** the model is not a Codex shell-command model
- **THEN** that model is not included in the `/backend-api/codex/models` response

#### Scenario: Unsupported Codex shell model included only in Codex-native catalog

- **WHEN** a model snapshot contains a model with `supported_in_api=false`
- **AND** the model has `shell_type="shell_command"`
- **THEN** that model is included in `/backend-api/codex/models.models`
- **AND** that model is not included in `/backend-api/codex/models.data`
- **AND** that model is not included in `/api/models` or `/v1/models`

#### Scenario: Allowed but unsupported model excluded

- **WHEN** a model is in the `allowed_models` set but has `supported_in_api=false`
- **AND** the model is not a Codex shell-command model
- **THEN** that model is not exposed in any model list endpoint

#### Scenario: gpt-5.3-codex aliases share availability gate consistently

- **WHEN** `gpt-5.3-codex` has `supported_in_api=false`
- **AND** `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` has `supported_in_api=true`
- **THEN** `/api/models`, `/v1/models`, and `/backend-api/codex/models.data`
      expose `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` but do not expose `gpt-5.3-codex`

#### Scenario: Consistent model set across endpoints

- **GIVEN** any model registry state
- **THEN** `/api/models`, `/v1/models`, and `/backend-api/codex/models.data` expose the same OpenAI-compatible set of models

### Requirement: Reservation 정산 exactly-once 보장

Usage reservation의 최종 정산(finalize 또는 release)은 요청 단위에서 정확히 1회 수행되어야 한다. 재시도 가능한 중간 attempt에서는 정산을 defer하고, 요청 종료 시점에서 단일 지점이 정산 책임을 갖는다. 시스템은 이 동작을 SHALL 보장해야 한다.

#### Scenario: 스트림 401 → refresh retry 성공 시 finalize 1회

- **WHEN** 첫 `_stream_once()` attempt에서 401을 수신하고 계정 refresh 후 재시도가 성공하면
- **THEN** 첫 attempt에서는 reservation 정산이 수행되지 않아야 한다 (SHALL)
- **AND** 최종 성공 시점에서 `finalize_usage_reservation()`이 정확히 1회 호출되어야 한다 (SHALL)
- **AND** 실제 token 사용량이 quota에 반영되어야 한다 (SHALL)

#### Scenario: 스트림 401 → retry 소진 실패 시 release 1회

- **WHEN** 401 후 재시도를 모두 소진하여 요청이 최종 실패하면
- **THEN** `release_usage_reservation()`이 정확히 1회 호출되어야 한다 (SHALL)
- **AND** 예약된 quota가 원복되어야 한다 (SHALL)

#### Scenario: 스트림 성공 시 finalize 1회

- **WHEN** `_stream_once()`가 retry 없이 첫 attempt에서 성공하면
- **THEN** `finalize_usage_reservation()`이 정확히 1회 호출되어야 한다 (SHALL)

### Requirement: 조기 종료 경로에서 reservation release 보장

Reservation 생성 후 upstream API 호출에 진입하지 않고 종료되는 모든 경로에서 reservation이 release되어야 한다. `reserved` 상태로 남는 reservation이 존재하면 안 된다. 시스템은 이 동작을 SHALL 보장해야 한다.

After admission commits an owned reservation, rate-limit response-header
calculation before upstream work remains part of the early-exit cleanup window.
If that calculation fails, the system MUST attempt to release the owned
reservation exactly once before propagating the original header failure.

#### Scenario: no_accounts 즉시 종료 시 release

- **WHEN** reservation 생성 후 `_stream_with_retry()`가 사용 가능한 계정 없음(`no_accounts`)으로 즉시 종료되면
- **THEN** `release_usage_reservation()`이 호출되어 reservation이 `released` 상태로 전이되어야 한다 (SHALL)
- **AND** pre-reserved quota가 원복되어야 한다 (SHALL)

#### Scenario: 재시도 소진 후 no_accounts 종료 시 release

- **WHEN** 재시도 루프가 모든 attempt를 소진한 후 `no_accounts`로 종료되면
- **THEN** `release_usage_reservation()`이 호출되어야 한다 (SHALL)

#### Scenario: reservation 미생성 시 정산 스킵

- **WHEN** API key auth가 비활성이거나 reservation이 생성되지 않은 상태에서 요청이 종료되면
- **THEN** 정산 로직이 안전하게 스킵되어야 하며 에러가 발생하지 않아야 한다 (SHALL)

#### Scenario: Rate-limit header preparation fails after admission

- **GIVEN** a limited API key has committed an owned reservation for a
  streaming Responses, collected Responses, compact Responses, or audio
  transcription request
- **WHEN** rate-limit response-header calculation fails before upstream work
  begins
- **THEN** the reservation is released exactly once
- **AND** its reserved quota is restored
- **AND** the header failure propagates without starting upstream work

### Requirement: Compact 경로 예외 무관 reservation cleanup

`_compact_responses()` 경로에서 reservation이 존재할 때, 어떤 예외 타입이 발생하더라도 reservation이 정리되어야 한다. 특정 예외 타입에만 의존하는 cleanup은 허용되지 않는다. 시스템은 이 동작을 SHALL 보장해야 한다.

#### Scenario: ProxyResponseError 발생 시 release

- **WHEN** `compact_responses()`에서 `ProxyResponseError`가 발생하면
- **THEN** reservation이 release되어야 한다 (SHALL)

#### Scenario: 예상 외 런타임 예외 발생 시 release

- **WHEN** `compact_responses()`에서 `ProxyResponseError` 외의 예외(`Exception`)가 발생하면
- **THEN** reservation이 동일하게 release되어야 한다 (SHALL)

#### Scenario: compact 성공 시 finalize

- **WHEN** `compact_responses()`가 정상 완료되면
- **THEN** `finalize_usage_reservation()`이 호출되어야 한다 (SHALL)

### Requirement: Finalize / Release 멱등성

`finalize_usage_reservation()`과 `release_usage_reservation()`은 이미 정산된(finalized 또는 released) reservation에 대해 안전하게 no-op 처리되어야 한다. 이중 호출이 quota를 이중 반영하거나 에러를 발생시키면 안 된다. 시스템은 이 동작을 SHALL 보장해야 한다.

#### Scenario: finalize 후 release 호출 시 no-op

- **WHEN** reservation이 이미 `finalized` 상태에서 `release_usage_reservation()`이 호출되면
- **THEN** 아무 동작 없이 반환되어야 한다 (SHALL)
- **AND** quota 값이 변경되지 않아야 한다 (SHALL)

#### Scenario: release 후 finalize 호출 시 no-op

- **WHEN** reservation이 이미 `released` 상태에서 `finalize_usage_reservation()`이 호출되면
- **THEN** 아무 동작 없이 반환되어야 한다 (SHALL)
- **AND** quota 값이 변경되지 않아야 한다 (SHALL)

#### Scenario: 동일 finalize 이중 호출 시 1회만 반영

- **WHEN** 동일 `reservation_id`로 `finalize_usage_reservation()`이 2회 호출되면
- **THEN** 사용량은 정확히 1회만 반영되어야 한다 (SHALL)

### Requirement: gpt-5.4-mini pricing is recognized

The system MUST recognize `gpt-5.4-mini` pricing when computing request costs. Snapshot aliases for the same model family MUST resolve to the canonical `gpt-5.4-mini` price table entry.

#### Scenario: gpt-5.4-mini request priced at standard tier

- **WHEN** a request for `gpt-5.4-mini` completes with standard service tier
- **THEN** the system computes non-zero cost using the configured `gpt-5.4-mini` standard rates

#### Scenario: gpt-5.4-mini snapshot request priced at canonical rates

- **WHEN** a request for `gpt-5.4-mini-2026-03-17` completes
- **THEN** the system resolves the snapshot alias to `gpt-5.4-mini`
- **AND** the system applies the same standard rates

### Requirement: API keys can read their own `/v1/usage`

The system SHALL expose `GET /v1/usage` for self-service usage lookup by API-key clients. The route MUST require a valid API key in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer authentication scheme even when `api_key_auth_enabled` is false globally. The response MUST include only data for the authenticated key and explicitly visible aggregate upstream quota sections, and MUST return:

- `request_count`
- `total_tokens`
- `cached_input_tokens`
- `total_cost_usd`
- `limits[]` containing limits configured on the authenticated API key, with `limit_type`, `limit_window`, `max_value`, `current_value`, `remaining_value`, `model_filter`, `reset_at`, and `source`. When no API-key limits are configured and aggregate upstream quota details are visible to the caller, `limits[]` MAY mirror those aggregate upstream credit windows for legacy client compatibility.
- `upstream_limits[]` containing aggregate upstream Codex credit windows when available, with the same fields and `source: "aggregate"`, subject to the key's `usage_sections` containing `upstream_limits`
- `account_pool_usage` containing `primary` and `secondary` float remaining percentages, subject to the key's `usage_sections` containing `account_pool_usage`

Validation failures MUST use the existing OpenAI error envelope used by `/v1/*` routes.

#### Scenario: Missing API key is rejected

- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /v1/usage` without a Bearer token
- **THEN** the system returns 401 in the OpenAI error format

#### Scenario: Invalid API key is rejected

- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /v1/usage` with an unknown, expired, or inactive Bearer key
- **THEN** the system returns 401 in the OpenAI error format

#### Scenario: Key with no usage returns zero totals

- **WHEN** a valid API key with no request-log usage calls `GET /v1/usage`
- **THEN** the system returns `request_count: 0`, `total_tokens: 0`, `cached_input_tokens: 0`, `total_cost_usd: 0.0`

#### Scenario: Usage is scoped to the authenticated key

- **WHEN** multiple API keys have request-log history and one of them calls `GET /v1/usage`
- **THEN** the response includes only the usage totals and limits for that authenticated key

#### Scenario: Upstream limits are separate from API-key limits

- **WHEN** an API key with its own limit calls `GET /v1/usage`
- **AND** upstream Codex aggregate usage data exists
- **THEN** `limits[]` contains the API-key limit values
- **AND** `upstream_limits[]` contains the aggregate Codex credit windows

#### Scenario: Upstream limits are mirrored for legacy clients without API-key limits

- **WHEN** an API key without its own limits calls `GET /v1/usage`
- **AND** upstream Codex aggregate usage data is visible to the key
- **THEN** `upstream_limits[]` contains the aggregate Codex credit windows
- **AND** `limits[]` contains the same aggregate Codex credit windows for legacy client compatibility

#### Scenario: Self-usage works while global proxy auth is disabled

- **WHEN** `api_key_auth_enabled` is false and a client calls `GET /v1/usage` with a valid Bearer key
- **THEN** the system still authenticates that key and returns the self-usage payload

### Requirement: API key cost accounting uses the billable service tier
API key cost accounting MUST continue to use the effective billable `service_tier` chosen for the request log and MUST NOT derive pricing from the operator-requested tier when the upstream reports a different actual tier.

#### Scenario: Requested and actual tiers differ
- **WHEN** a priced request is sent with `requested_service_tier: "priority"`
- **AND** the upstream reports `actual_service_tier: "default"`
- **THEN** the persisted billable `service_tier` is `default`
- **AND** API key cost accounting uses the `default` tier rate for that request

### Requirement: API keys can enforce a service tier

The dashboard API key CRUD surface MUST allow callers to persist an optional enforced service tier. The service MUST normalize `fast` to the canonical upstream value `priority` before persistence and before returning the API key payload.

#### Scenario: Create API key with fast service tier alias

- **WHEN** a dashboard client creates an API key with `enforcedServiceTier: "fast"`
- **THEN** the request is accepted
- **AND** the persisted API key stores the canonical value `priority`
- **AND** the response returns `enforcedServiceTier: "priority"`

#### Scenario: Update API key with canonical service tier

- **WHEN** a dashboard client updates an API key with `enforcedServiceTier: "flex"`
- **THEN** the persisted API key stores `flex`
- **AND** subsequent reads return `flex`

### Requirement: API key list includes pooled credit data

The `GET /api/api-keys/` list endpoint SHALL include per-key pooled credit data computed by aggregating upstream usage across the selectable accounts assigned to each key. When a key has no assigned accounts, the system SHALL pool across all selectable accounts.

Selectable accounts exclude accounts whose status is `paused` or `deactivated`, matching load-balancer routing eligibility.

The response SHALL include `pooled_remaining_percent_primary` (float or null), `pooled_remaining_percent_secondary` (float or null), and `pooled_capacity_credits_primary` (float, default 0.0) on each key object.

When `pooled_capacity_credits_primary` is 0.0 (e.g., all assigned accounts are free-tier), `pooled_remaining_percent_primary` SHALL be null. Primary samples whose `reset_at` has elapsed SHALL be pooled as reset windows rather than frozen values, and when no live (unexpired) primary sample exists across the pooled accounts, `pooled_remaining_percent_primary` SHALL be null instead of an optimistic value.

#### Scenario: Scoped key pools assigned accounts only

- **WHEN** an API key has `assignedAccountIds` containing two accounts
- **AND** those accounts have usage data
- **THEN** `pooled_remaining_percent_primary` and `pooled_remaining_percent_secondary` reflect only those two accounts

#### Scenario: Unscoped key pools all accounts

- **WHEN** an API key has `assignedAccountIds` = []
- **THEN** pooled credit fields reflect all accounts in the system

#### Scenario: Free-tier accounts hide primary bar

- **WHEN** all assigned accounts have plan_type "free" (primary capacity = 0)
- **THEN** `pooled_capacity_credits_primary` = 0.0
- **AND** `pooled_remaining_percent_primary` = null

#### Scenario: Absent primary windows hide the pooled primary bar

- **WHEN** upstream stopped reporting the primary window and every pooled account's primary sample has an elapsed `reset_at` or no primary sample at all
- **THEN** `pooled_remaining_percent_primary` = null

#### Scenario: Paused and deactivated accounts are excluded

- **WHEN** an API key has assigned accounts with active and paused statuses
- **THEN** pooled credit fields reflect only the active selectable accounts

### Requirement: API key 7-day usage includes account cost breakdown

`GET /api/api-keys/{key_id}/usage-7d` SHALL return `accountCosts[]` in addition to the existing 7-day totals for the selected API key. Each `accountCosts[]` item SHALL include `accountId`, `email`, `costUsd`, and `isDeleted`.

The system MUST aggregate `accountCosts[]` from request-log rows whose `api_key_id` matches the selected key and whose `requested_at` falls inside the rolling 7-day window used by the endpoint totals.

#### Scenario: Account costs are sorted by descending cost
- **WHEN** a client loads `GET /api/api-keys/{key_id}/usage-7d`
- **AND** multiple grouped account-cost buckets exist in the 7-day window
- **THEN** `accountCosts[]` is ordered by `costUsd` descending

#### Scenario: Unknown account usage remains separate
- **WHEN** request-log rows in the 7-day window have `account_id = NULL`
- **AND** those rows are not soft-deleted
- **THEN** the response includes an `accountCosts[]` item with `accountId: null`, `email: null`, and `isDeleted: false`

#### Scenario: Deleted account usage is grouped into one bucket
- **WHEN** request-log rows in the 7-day window are marked deleted
- **THEN** the response groups their cost into a synthetic `accountCosts[]` item with `accountId: null`, `email: null`, and `isDeleted: true`

#### Scenario: Deleted and unknown account usage stay distinct
- **WHEN** the same API key has both soft-deleted request-log cost and unknown non-deleted request-log cost inside the 7-day window
- **THEN** the response returns separate `accountCosts[]` items for the deleted and non-deleted buckets

### Requirement: API key 7-day account-cost queries use a composite request-log index

The database SHALL provide an index that supports filtering request logs by API key and 7-day requested-at range before grouping by account for the API-key account-cost breakdown.

#### Scenario: Composite account-cost index exists after migration
- **WHEN** database migrations are applied
- **THEN** the `request_logs` table includes an index covering `api_key_id`, descending `requested_at`, and `account_id`

### Requirement: Request-aware API-key usage reservations

API-key usage reservation admission MUST reserve a bounded request-aware budget instead of an unconditional fixed 8192 input-token plus 8192 output-token pre-charge for every request. The reservation budget MUST be used only for admission and in-flight accounting; final usage accounting MUST continue to settle to the authoritative completed request usage and service-tier pricing.

For token limits, admission MUST reserve from the request input and output token budgets. The input budget MAY be estimated from self-contained request payloads, while opaque upstream context MUST fall back to a conservative input budget. The output budget MUST use a bounded system default unless codex-lb can verify that a client-provided output cap is actually enforced upstream. For `cost_usd` limits, admission MUST compute the reservation cost from the same input and output token budgets and the effective request service tier. Reservation finalization MUST adjust every applicable reserved value to actual completed usage exactly once, including limits whose admission reservation was zero.

#### Scenario: Concurrent priority lanes do not require 8 × 8192 output-token headroom

- **WHEN** an API key has a `cost_usd` limit with enough remaining value for the bounded request-aware reservations
- **AND** eight `gpt-5.5` requests using `service_tier = "priority"` are admitted concurrently
- **THEN** the proxy allows all eight reservations instead of rejecting a lane solely because the old 8192-output-token pre-charge would exceed the limit

#### Scenario: Opaque input uses conservative input fallback

- **WHEN** a request references input that the proxy cannot size locally, such as `previous_response_id`, `conversation`, `input_file`, or `input_image`
- **THEN** API-key admission uses the conservative default input-token reservation budget for input tokens
- **AND** final accounting still settles to actual completed usage

#### Scenario: Zero-reservation limits still settle actual usage

- **WHEN** API-key admission records a zero-delta reservation item for an applicable limit
- **AND** the request completes with non-zero actual usage for that limit
- **THEN** reservation finalization increments the limit by the actual usage instead of skipping the limit

### Requirement: Map `auto`/`default` enforced service tier to outbound omission
When a request is enforced under an API key whose `enforced_service_tier` is `auto` or `default`, the proxy MUST forward the request with `service_tier` absent (`None`) rather than as the literal string. Enforcement of `priority` and `flex` MUST continue to forward the literal value unchanged. codex-lb accepts `auto`, `default`, `priority`, and `flex` (plus the `fast` alias for `priority`) at the API-key `enforced_service_tier` surface; the ChatGPT/Codex backend rejects `auto` and `default` as literal values, since both already mean "let upstream pick".

#### Scenario: Enforced service tier is `default`
- **WHEN** a request is processed under an API key with `enforced_service_tier = "default"`
- **THEN** the outbound `service_tier` field is absent

#### Scenario: Enforced service tier is `auto`
- **WHEN** a request is processed under an API key with `enforced_service_tier = "auto"`
- **THEN** the outbound `service_tier` field is absent

#### Scenario: Enforced service tier is a real upstream tier
- **WHEN** a request is processed under an API key with `enforced_service_tier = "priority"` or `"flex"`
- **THEN** the outbound `service_tier` field equals the enforced value

### Requirement: API key allowlist allows Cursor aliases

The model allowlist check MUST treat supported Cursor-style GPT-5 aliases as equivalent to their
canonical GPT model when deciding access. A request for the canonical model must be allowed when the key
stores a compatible alias in `allowed_models`.

#### Scenario: Cursor alias allowed model permits canonical request

- **WHEN** a key has `allowed_models: ["gpt-5.4-mini-high"]`
- **AND** a request is made for model `gpt-5.4-mini`
- **THEN** the proxy permits the request because the allowed alias resolves to the requested canonical model

### Requirement: Model catalogs must expose canonical models for alias allowlists

When API-key model allowlists include Cursor-style aliases, the visible model lists MUST expose canonical model IDs and
omit alias-only synthetic IDs so clients see stable model names.

#### Scenario: Model list canonicalizes Cursor aliases

- **WHEN** a key with `allowed_models: ["gpt-5.4-mini-high"]` and `enforced_model: "gpt-5.4-mini-high"` calls `GET /v1/models`
- **THEN** the response contains the canonical model `gpt-5.4-mini`
- **AND** the response does not expose a synthetic `gpt-5.4-mini-high` model id

#### Scenario: Codex model list visibility canonicalizes Cursor aliases

- **WHEN** a key with `allowed_models: ["gpt-5.4-mini-high"]`, `enforced_model: "gpt-5.4-mini-high"`, and `apply_to_codex_model=true` calls `GET /backend-api/codex/models`
- **THEN** the canonical `gpt-5.4-mini` entry is visible with `visibility: "list"`
- **AND** other entries are hidden according to the API key allowlist policy

### Requirement: API Keys Declare Traffic Class

API keys SHALL have a `traffic_class` value. The default SHALL be `foreground`. The system SHALL also accept `opportunistic` for clients that may only use burnable quota.

#### Scenario: Create opportunistic key
- **WHEN** admin creates an API key with `trafficClass: "opportunistic"`
- **THEN** the key is persisted and returned with `trafficClass: "opportunistic"`

#### Scenario: Omitted traffic class defaults to foreground
- **WHEN** admin creates an API key without `trafficClass`
- **THEN** the key is persisted and returned with `trafficClass: "foreground"`

### Requirement: Assigned-account quota badges reflect monthly-only free accounts

The API key create and edit dialogs SHALL display assigned-account quota badges according to the normalized quota model of each account.

#### Scenario: Free account shows monthly badge only
- **WHEN** assigned-account selection renders a free account whose normalized quota model is monthly-only
- **THEN** the dialog shows a `Monthly <percent>% left` badge for that account
- **AND** it does not show a weekly-left badge for that account

#### Scenario: Paid account retains 5h and 7d badges
- **WHEN** assigned-account selection renders an account with normalized 5h and 7d quota windows
- **THEN** the dialog shows `5h <percent>% left` and `7d <percent>% left` badges for that account

### Requirement: API keys can enforce extended reasoning efforts

The dashboard API key CRUD surface MUST allow callers to persist optional
enforced reasoning efforts advertised by the model catalog, including extended
GPT-5.6 efforts `max` and `ultra`.

#### Scenario: API key accepts extended enforced reasoning effort on create

- **WHEN** a dashboard client creates an API key with `enforcedReasoningEffort: "ultra"`
- **THEN** the request is accepted
- **AND** the response returns `enforcedReasoningEffort: "ultra"`

#### Scenario: API key accepts extended enforced reasoning effort on update

- **WHEN** a dashboard client updates an API key with `enforcedReasoningEffort: "max"`
- **THEN** the request is accepted
- **AND** the response returns `enforcedReasoningEffort: "max"`

### Requirement: Per-key transport policy override

Each API key record MUST carry an optional `transport_policy_override`
field (nullable, default `null`). When non-null, its value MUST be one of
`"smart"`, `"always_http"`, or `"always_websocket"`, and it MUST be used
as the effective downstream-HTTP transport routing policy for requests
authenticated by that key, taking precedence over the global
`http_downstream_transport_policy`. When `null`, requests authenticated
by the key MUST follow the global policy.

The field MUST be settable on creation (`POST /api/api-keys`, optional)
and on update (`PATCH /api/api-keys/{id}`), MUST be returned on key reads
as `transportPolicyOverride`, and MUST be persisted via an additive
nullable column. Existing rows MUST default to `null` (follow global) so
the migration is backward compatible with no behavior change for keys
that never set an override.

#### Scenario: Create key with transport policy override

- **WHEN** admin submits `POST /api/api-keys` with `{ "name": "graphiti", "transportPolicyOverride": "always_http" }`
- **THEN** the created key returns `transportPolicyOverride = "always_http"`

#### Scenario: Create key without override defaults to null

- **WHEN** admin submits `POST /api/api-keys` without `transportPolicyOverride`
- **THEN** the created key returns `transportPolicyOverride = null`
- **AND** the key follows the global `http_downstream_transport_policy`

#### Scenario: Existing keys migrate to null override

- **GIVEN** API key rows created before this change
- **WHEN** the additive migration runs
- **THEN** every existing row has `transport_policy_override = null`
- **AND** those keys follow the global policy with no behavior change

### Requirement: API key usage_sections controls visible /v1/usage detail sections

The system SHALL accept an optional `usage_sections` field in `POST /api/api-keys` and `PATCH /api/api-keys/{id}`. The field SHALL be a comma-separated string of section names. Supported values SHALL be `upstream_limits` and `account_pool_usage`. When `usage_sections` is omitted during creation, the system SHALL default it to `"upstream_limits,account_pool_usage"`.

The `ApiKeyResponse` SHALL include `usage_sections` as a string.

#### Scenario: Create key with explicit usage_sections

- **WHEN** admin submits `POST /api/api-keys` with `{ "name": "dev-key", "usageSections": "upstream_limits" }`
- **THEN** the created key returns `usageSections: "upstream_limits"`

#### Scenario: Create key without usage_sections defaults to all

- **WHEN** admin submits `POST /api/api-keys` without `usageSections`
- **THEN** the created key returns `usageSections: "upstream_limits,account_pool_usage"`

#### Scenario: Update key usage_sections

- **WHEN** admin submits `PATCH /api/api-keys/{id}` with `{ "usageSections": "account_pool_usage" }`
- **THEN** the key returns `usageSections: "account_pool_usage"`

#### Scenario: Reject unknown usage_sections values

- **WHEN** admin submits `POST /api/api-keys` with `usageSections` containing an unsupported value
- **THEN** the system returns 400

### Requirement: API-key quota privacy toggle
The system SHALL provide a `hide_upstream_quota_from_api_keys` boolean in `DashboardSettings`, defaulting to `false`. The dashboard settings API SHALL accept and return this field.

#### Scenario: Default preserves current behavior

- **WHEN** the setting is not enabled
- **THEN** API-key-authenticated requests continue to receive upstream quota details exactly as they do today

#### Scenario: API-key usage response hides upstream limits

- **GIVEN** `hide_upstream_quota_from_api_keys` is `true`
- **WHEN** an API-key-authenticated client calls `GET /v1/usage`
- **THEN** the response SHALL omit upstream quota entries
- **AND** the response SHALL still include the API key's own quota data

#### Scenario: API-key usage response hides account pool usage

- **GIVEN** `hide_upstream_quota_from_api_keys` is `true`
- **AND** the API key's `usage_sections` includes `account_pool_usage`
- **WHEN** an API-key-authenticated client calls `GET /v1/usage`
- **THEN** the response SHALL set `account_pool_usage` to `null`
- **AND** the privacy toggle SHALL take precedence over the API key's `usage_sections`

#### Scenario: Proxy responses hide upstream quota headers

- **GIVEN** `hide_upstream_quota_from_api_keys` is `true`
- **WHEN** an API-key-authenticated client calls a protected proxy route that emits quota headers
- **THEN** the response SHALL NOT include `x-codex-primary-*`, `x-codex-secondary-*`, or `x-codex-credits-*` headers
- **AND** internal routing headers such as `x-codex-turn-state` SHALL remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Dashboard views stay visible

- **GIVEN** `hide_upstream_quota_from_api_keys` is `true`
- **WHEN** an owner views dashboard settings or owner-facing usage data without API-key authentication
- **THEN** upstream quota details SHALL remain visible

### Requirement: API keys can inspect and redeem reset credits within their account pool

The system SHALL expose `GET /v1/reset-credit` and `POST /v1/reset-credit` for API-key-authenticated self-service reset-credit access. Both routes MUST require a valid `Authorization: Bearer sk-clb-...` header even when `api_key_auth_enabled` is false globally. Validation failures MUST use the existing OpenAI error envelope used by `/v1/*` routes.

The target account pool SHALL be derived from the authenticated API key. If `account_assignment_scope_enabled=true`, only `assigned_account_ids` SHALL be eligible. If account scope is not enabled, all selectable accounts SHALL be eligible.

`GET /v1/reset-credit` SHALL return only credits for the authenticated key's eligible account pool. `POST /v1/reset-credit` SHALL reject requests whose `account_id` is outside that pool.

Before `POST /v1/reset-credit` decrypts and forwards the bearer token for the upstream consume call, the system SHALL refresh the target account with the normal account-token freshness rules and use the refreshed account credentials for the consume request.

If that self-service credential refresh fails, `POST /v1/reset-credit` SHALL stop before the upstream consume call, return a client-actionable conflict response, and keep using the existing `/v1/*` OpenAI error envelope.

After acquiring the cross-replica redeem claim, `POST /v1/reset-credit` SHALL re-validate the requested `redeem_id` against a live upstream reset-credits fetch performed inside the serialized redeem section using the refreshed account credentials, regardless of whether the replica-local snapshot lists the credit as available. It MUST NOT consume a credit solely on the basis of the replica-local snapshot, because a peer replica may have redeemed that credit while this request waited for the claim and the local snapshot can remain stale until its invalidation poll fires. The upstream fetch response is authoritative: if the credit is available upstream the redemption proceeds; otherwise the endpoint returns 409 and replaces the cached snapshot for that account with the fresh upstream snapshot.

On a successful `POST /v1/reset-credit` redemption, the system SHALL invalidate the redeemed account's cached reset-credit snapshot, force a usage refresh for that account, and invalidate account-selection cache state when that usage refresh writes updated usage. A failed or empty post-redeem usage refresh SHALL NOT roll back the successful credit redemption response.

#### Scenario: Missing API key is rejected

- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /v1/reset-credit` or `POST /v1/reset-credit` without a Bearer token
- **THEN** the system returns 401 in the OpenAI error format

#### Scenario: Invalid API key is rejected

- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /v1/reset-credit` or `POST /v1/reset-credit` with an unknown, expired, or inactive Bearer key
- **THEN** the system returns 401 in the OpenAI error format

#### Scenario: Scoped API key sees only assigned accounts

- **WHEN** an API key has account scope enabled with assigned accounts
- **AND** the client calls `GET /v1/reset-credit`
- **THEN** the response includes reset-credit entries only for those assigned accounts

#### Scenario: Unscoped API key can read the full selectable pool

- **WHEN** an API key has account scope disabled
- **AND** the client calls `GET /v1/reset-credit`
- **THEN** the response may include reset-credit entries for any selectable account that currently has an available cached credit

#### Scenario: Out-of-pool account is rejected on redeem

- **WHEN** a client calls `POST /v1/reset-credit` with an `account_id` outside the authenticated API key's eligible pool
- **THEN** the system returns 403 without redeeming any credit

#### Scenario: Self-service reset-credit works while global proxy auth is disabled

- **WHEN** `api_key_auth_enabled` is false and a client calls `GET /v1/reset-credit` or `POST /v1/reset-credit` with a valid Bearer key
- **THEN** the system still authenticates that key and applies the same account-pool rules

#### Scenario: Self-service redemption refreshes stale account credentials before consume

- **GIVEN** an eligible account has a redeemable reset credit
- **AND** the persisted access token for that account is stale but refreshable
- **WHEN** a client successfully calls `POST /v1/reset-credit` for that account
- **THEN** codex-lb refreshes the account before decrypting the consume bearer token
- **AND** the upstream reset-credit consume call uses the refreshed account credentials

#### Scenario: Self-service redemption surfaces refresh failures as conflicts

- **GIVEN** an eligible account has a redeemable reset credit
- **AND** that account's credential refresh fails before the upstream consume call
- **WHEN** a client calls `POST /v1/reset-credit` for that account
- **THEN** codex-lb returns a conflict response in the standard `/v1/*` OpenAI error envelope
- **AND** codex-lb does not call upstream reset-credit consume for that request

#### Scenario: Fresh replica redeems a credit missing from its local snapshot

- **GIVEN** a freshly started replica whose reset-credit snapshot store is empty for the target account
- **AND** upstream reports the requested `redeem_id` as available
- **WHEN** a client calls `POST /v1/reset-credit` for that account and `redeem_id`
- **THEN** the replica fetches the account's reset credits from upstream inside the serialized redeem section
- **AND** the redemption proceeds and succeeds instead of returning a false 409

#### Scenario: Credit already redeemed elsewhere returns 409 with a fresh snapshot

- **GIVEN** the replica-local snapshot does not list the requested `redeem_id` as available
- **AND** the authoritative upstream fetch reports that credit as unavailable
- **WHEN** a client calls `POST /v1/reset-credit` for that account and `redeem_id`
- **THEN** the endpoint returns 409 without calling upstream consume
- **AND** the fresh upstream snapshot replaces the replica's cached snapshot for that account

#### Scenario: Stale cached credit is re-validated after winning the claim

- **GIVEN** two replicas both cached the same reset credit as available
- **AND** replica A redeemed it while replica B waited on the cross-replica redeem claim
- **AND** replica B's cached snapshot still lists that `redeem_id` as available
- **WHEN** replica B wins the claim and processes `POST /v1/reset-credit` for that `redeem_id`
- **THEN** replica B performs the authoritative upstream fetch instead of consuming from its stale cache
- **AND** because upstream reports the credit unavailable, replica B returns 409 without sending a second upstream consume
- **AND** replica B replaces its cached snapshot with the fresh upstream snapshot

#### Scenario: Successful self-service redemption refreshes usage for immediate follow-up traffic

- **GIVEN** an eligible account has a redeemable reset credit and persisted usage/account state that still reflects a blocked window
- **WHEN** a client successfully calls `POST /v1/reset-credit` for that account
- **THEN** the redeemed account's cached reset-credit snapshot is invalidated
- **AND** codex-lb forces a usage refresh for that account before returning
- **AND** any account-selection cache entry derived from the stale usage state is invalidated when the refresh writes updated usage
- **AND** the response still returns the upstream `{code, windows_reset, redeemed_at}` success payload

### Requirement: API keys may be scoped to model sources

The system SHALL allow API keys to be scoped to zero or more model-source ids in
addition to existing account assignments and model allowlists. Source scoping
MUST be represented separately from account assignment scoping and MUST expose a
source-assignment-scope-enabled state in API-key read contracts. When an API key
has source assignment scope disabled, it MAY use any enabled source subject to
model allowlists and route eligibility. When source assignment scope is enabled,
source-routed requests and model listing MUST be restricted to the assigned
source ids.

#### Scenario: Key without source assignments can see enabled source models

- **GIVEN** an API key has no assigned source ids
- **AND** source assignment scope is disabled
- **AND** its model allowlist permits `local-coder`
- **WHEN** the key calls `GET /v1/models`
- **THEN** enabled `local-coder` source entries are eligible for listing

#### Scenario: Key with source assignments is restricted

- **GIVEN** an API key is assigned to source `src_a`
- **AND** source `src_b` also exposes model `local-coder`
- **WHEN** the key calls `GET /v1/models`
- **THEN** only entries from `src_a` are eligible

#### Scenario: Deleted assigned source does not broaden access

- **GIVEN** an API key is assigned to source `src_a`
- **AND** source `src_b` also exposes model `local-coder`
- **WHEN** `src_a` is deleted
- **THEN** the API key remains source-assignment scoped with no assigned source ids
- **AND** source `src_b` is not eligible for model listing or routing

### Requirement: Source-routed usage uses API-key reservations

The system MUST reserve API-key usage before forwarding an OpenAI-compatible
source-routed request authenticated by an API key, and MUST finalize the
reservation from the upstream OpenAI-compatible `usage` payload when the
request completes.
The finalized input, output, cached-input, and cost values MUST update the same
API-key limit and usage-reporting paths used by subscription-backed requests.

#### Scenario: Source-routed response finalizes token usage

- **WHEN** an API key calls a source-routed model and the upstream response
  includes `usage.prompt_tokens=100` and `usage.completion_tokens=20`
- **THEN** the API-key reservation is finalized with 100 input tokens and 20
  output tokens
- **AND** `/v1/usage` for that key reflects the completed usage

#### Scenario: Missing usage fails closed for limited keys

- **GIVEN** an API key has a token or cost limit
- **WHEN** a source-routed response succeeds but lacks usable OpenAI `usage`
  fields
- **THEN** the system does not silently finalize zero usage
- **AND** the request fails or is marked failed according to the source-routing
  error contract

### Requirement: Stream reservation settlement is detached from the response path

Settling a stream API-key reservation MUST NOT block the response/stream close,
with one deliberate exception: when a keyed websocket stream terminates with an
account-health error, the finalizer MUST wait for the settlement to commit
before the load-balancer health write (the settlement-ordering invariant), so
that error path intentionally blocks on settlement. If the primary settlement
fails, the finalizer MUST wait for fallback release to commit before recording
account health. If neither operation confirms settlement, the account-health
write MUST remain unapplied. Tracked persistence ownership MUST remain
registered through an ordering-sensitive fallback release, including
cancellation before the primary coroutine starts or during that release, so
graceful shutdown drains both phases. When the existing stream-retry path
deliberately defers an
account-health penalty until the same ordering-sensitive settlement, it MUST
likewise apply neither that penalty nor an immediately following terminal health
write unless settlement is confirmed, and it MUST NOT start a second settlement
for the transferred reservation. In all other cases the settlement MUST run as
a tracked background task; when it fails or is cancelled, the reservation MUST
still be released by the tracking fallback, and the request's finalization path
MUST NOT double-release a transferred settlement. Reservations MUST continue to
count toward key limits until finalized or released, so deferred settlement can
never admit usage a synchronous settlement would have rejected.

#### Scenario: Response close precedes settlement completion

- **GIVEN** a keyed stream whose settlement transaction is still running
- **WHEN** the stream closes
- **THEN** the close does not wait for the settlement
- **AND** the settlement finalizes the reservation exactly once in the background

#### Scenario: Failed detached settlement still releases the reservation

- **GIVEN** a detached settlement whose finalize raises
- **WHEN** the settlement task completes
- **THEN** the tracking fallback releases the reservation

#### Scenario: Websocket health-error settlement precedes the health write

- **GIVEN** a keyed websocket stream that terminates with an account-health error
- **WHEN** the finalizer settles the reservation
- **THEN** it waits for the settlement to commit before recording the account-health error

#### Scenario: Websocket health waits for fallback settlement

- **GIVEN** a keyed websocket stream that terminates with an account-health error
- **AND** its primary settlement fails
- **WHEN** fallback release remains in progress
- **THEN** the finalizer does not record the account-health error
- **AND** it records the error only after fallback release commits

#### Scenario: Unconfirmed websocket settlement leaves health unapplied

- **GIVEN** a keyed websocket stream that terminates with an account-health error
- **WHEN** both primary settlement and fallback release fail
- **THEN** the finalizer does not record the account-health error
- **AND** the upstream connection is still scheduled for reconnect and retirement

#### Scenario: Unconfirmed retry settlement drops deferred health

- **GIVEN** a keyed stream retry has deferred an account-health penalty until replacement selection
- **WHEN** neither primary settlement nor fallback release confirms settlement
- **THEN** the deferred penalty and any immediately following terminal health write remain unapplied
- **AND** the retry path does not start a second settlement for the transferred reservation

#### Scenario: Shutdown drains pending settlements

- **WHEN** the service shuts down gracefully with settlements in flight
- **THEN** shutdown waits for them up to the configured drain timeout
- **AND** a pending ordering-sensitive fallback release remains part of that drain despite cancellation before primary startup or during fallback

### Requirement: Untrusted forwarded headers do not grant unauthenticated proxy locality

When API-key authentication is disabled and proxy-header trust is enabled, forwarded client-IP headers from a socket peer outside every configured trusted-proxy CIDR MUST NOT cause a protected proxy request to be classified as local. Such a request MUST remain blocked unless its raw socket peer independently matches `proxy_unauthenticated_client_cidrs`.

#### Scenario: Untrusted loopback proxy remains blocked

- **WHEN** API-key authentication is disabled
- **AND** proxy-header trust is enabled
- **AND** the raw loopback socket peer is outside every configured trusted-proxy CIDR
- **AND** a forwarded client-IP header is present
- **AND** the raw socket peer is outside `proxy_unauthenticated_client_cidrs`
- **THEN** the protected proxy request is rejected with HTTP 401

#### Scenario: Explicit raw-socket allowlist remains authoritative

- **WHEN** the raw socket peer belongs to `proxy_unauthenticated_client_cidrs`
- **THEN** the protected proxy request may proceed without API-key authentication
- **AND** forwarded header contents do not determine that allowlist match

### Requirement: Direct-local proxy access inspects every forwarded client hint field

When API-key authentication and proxy-header trust are disabled, a loopback socket peer MUST qualify for direct-local protected proxy access only when no non-empty forwarded client-IP field value is present. The system MUST inspect every repeated field value; a later non-empty value MUST keep the request blocked unless the raw socket peer independently matches `proxy_unauthenticated_client_cidrs`.

#### Scenario: Later duplicate forwarded hint remains unauthorized

- **WHEN** API-key authentication and proxy-header trust are disabled
- **AND** a loopback request contains an empty `X-Forwarded-For` field followed by a non-empty `X-Forwarded-For` field
- **AND** the raw socket peer is outside `proxy_unauthenticated_client_cidrs`
- **THEN** the protected proxy request is rejected with HTTP 401

### Requirement: GPT-5.6 usage cost pricing matches the current published rates

When computing API-key usage, request-log, reservation, or aggregate cost for the canonical GPT-5.6 models, the system MUST use these USD-per-1M-token rates
for input, cached input, and output:

| Model | Standard | Fast/priority | Flex | Standard long context |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gpt-5.6-sol` | `5 / 0.50 / 30` | `10 / 1 / 60` | `2.5 / 0.25 / 15` | `10 / 1 / 45` |
| `gpt-5.6-terra` | `2 / 0.20 / 12` | `4 / 0.40 / 24` | `1 / 0.10 / 6` | `4 / 0.40 / 18` |
| `gpt-5.6-luna` | `0.20 / 0.02 / 1.20` | `0.40 / 0.04 / 2.40` | `0.10 / 0.01 / 0.60` | `0.40 / 0.04 / 1.80` |

The existing `priority` and `fast` service-tier aliases MUST use the
Fast/priority rates. Standard long-context rates MUST apply only when input
tokens exceed 272,000. Flex long-context pricing MUST continue to use the
existing Flex short-context rates and multipliers. Model aliases with a
version or snapshot suffix MUST resolve to the corresponding canonical table
entry.

Batch rates and cache-write rates MUST NOT be introduced into this contract
without corresponding proxy request and usage fields.

#### Scenario: Terra standard usage uses the current rate

- **WHEN** a standard-tier `gpt-5.6-terra` request has 200,000 input tokens and 1,000,000 output tokens
- **THEN** the token cost is `$12.40`

#### Scenario: Luna Fast and Flex usage use their tier rates

- **WHEN** a `gpt-5.6-luna` request has 200,000 input tokens, 100,000 cached input tokens, and 1,000,000 output tokens
- **AND** the request uses `priority` or `fast`
- **THEN** the token cost is `$2.444`
- **WHEN** the same usage uses `flex`
- **THEN** the token cost is `$0.611`

#### Scenario: Terra standard long-context usage uses the current long-context rate

- **WHEN** a standard-tier `gpt-5.6-terra` request has 300,000 input tokens, 50,000 cached input tokens, and 100,000 output tokens
- **THEN** the token cost is `$2.82`

#### Scenario: Versioned aliases use canonical GPT-5.6 pricing

- **WHEN** the requested model is `gpt-5.6-luna-2026-07-13`
- **THEN** cost accounting resolves it to the `gpt-5.6-luna` price entry

### Requirement: API key last-used tracking is write-behind and coalesced

The system SHALL track `api_keys.last_used_at` through a process-local write-behind coalescer instead of writing the column inside each reservation-settlement transaction. Settlement paths MUST record the key's used-at timestamp in memory (keyed by API key id, keeping the per-key maximum), and a replica-local periodic flusher (constant 30-second interval, not leader-gated) MUST fold all pending touches into the database in a single transaction per flush. Every flushed write MUST apply monotonic greatest-wins semantics — the stored `last_used_at` is only advanced, never regressed, even when multiple replicas flush out of order (`GREATEST(coalesce(last_used_at, epoch), :new)` semantics; the dialect-portable guarded UPDATE `WHERE last_used_at IS NULL OR last_used_at < :new` is an acceptable implementation on both PostgreSQL and SQLite). Graceful shutdown MUST flush every recorded touch: the flusher's stop sequence MUST switch the coalescer to shutdown write-through mode before performing the final flush, so a touch recorded after (or concurrently with) the final flush — for example by a settlement task that outlived the shutdown drain of persistence tasks — is flushed immediately by the recording path itself instead of being parked in a pending map that no longer has a flusher. Shutdown-path flushes (the final flush and write-through flushes after it) MUST retry transient failures a bounded number of times (3 attempts with a short constant backoff); if every attempt fails, the pending touches (API key ids and their timestamps) MUST be logged at WARNING so operators can reconstruct the lost values, and the failure MUST NOT propagate to the caller. On process crash, losing at most one flush interval (~30 seconds) of `last_used_at` freshness is accepted: the column's only consumer is the dashboard API response field (`lastUsedAt`), which no routing, ordering, or enforcement logic reads, so observed staleness of up to the flush interval is a display-only effect. A failed periodic flush MUST retain the pending touches for a later flush rather than dropping them.

#### Scenario: Many settlements within one interval flush as one write per key

- **GIVEN** an API key that settles many requests within one flush interval
- **WHEN** the periodic flush runs
- **THEN** the key receives exactly one `last_used_at` write carrying the latest recorded used-at timestamp
- **AND** none of the individual settlement transactions wrote `last_used_at`

#### Scenario: Flush never moves last_used_at backwards

- **GIVEN** a stored `last_used_at` newer than a pending recorded timestamp (for example another replica already flushed a later touch)
- **WHEN** the flush applies the pending timestamp
- **THEN** the stored `last_used_at` keeps the newer value

#### Scenario: Graceful shutdown flushes pending touches

- **GIVEN** recorded touches that have not yet been flushed
- **WHEN** the application shuts down gracefully
- **THEN** the pending touches are flushed to the database before the process exits

#### Scenario: Failed flush retains pending touches

- **GIVEN** a flush attempt that fails (for example a transient database error)
- **WHEN** the next flush tick runs
- **THEN** the previously pending touches are flushed, merged with any touches recorded in between (per-key maximum wins)

#### Scenario: Shutdown final flush retries a transient failure

- **GIVEN** pending touches and a database that fails the first final-flush attempt with a transient error
- **WHEN** the application shuts down gracefully
- **THEN** the final flush is retried after a short backoff and the touches are persisted before the process exits

#### Scenario: Shutdown final flush exhausts its retries

- **GIVEN** pending touches and a database that fails every final-flush attempt
- **WHEN** the bounded retries are exhausted
- **THEN** a WARNING is logged containing the pending API key ids and their timestamps
- **AND** shutdown proceeds without raising

#### Scenario: Touch recorded after the shutdown flush writes through

- **GIVEN** a settlement task that outlived the shutdown drain of persistence tasks
- **WHEN** it records a touch after the flusher has stopped and performed its final flush
- **THEN** the touch is flushed to the database immediately by the recording path rather than being lost at process exit

### Requirement: GPT-5.6 personality pricing is recognized

The system MUST recognize `gpt-5.6`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna` when computing request costs. The bare `gpt-5.6` alias MUST resolve to Sol, and suffixed aliases for each personality model MUST resolve to the matching canonical pricing entry. Standard, Flex, Priority, and requests with more than 272K input tokens MUST use the published rates applicable to the model and tier.

#### Scenario: Canonical GPT-5.6 models use personality-specific pricing

- **WHEN** a standard-tier request completes for `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, or `gpt-5.6-luna`
- **THEN** the system computes cost using that model's standard input, cached-input, and output rates

#### Scenario: Bare GPT-5.6 alias resolves to Sol pricing

- **WHEN** a request completes for `gpt-5.6`
- **THEN** the system resolves it to the canonical Sol pricing entry
- **AND** the system does not use the generic `gpt-5` pricing entry

#### Scenario: Suffixed GPT-5.6 model resolves to its personality price

- **WHEN** a request completes for a suffixed GPT-5.6 personality model ID
- **THEN** the system resolves it to the matching canonical Sol, Terra, or Luna pricing entry
- **AND** the system does not use the generic `gpt-5` pricing entry

#### Scenario: GPT-5.6 service tiers use published tier rates

- **WHEN** a GPT-5.6 request completes with `service_tier: "flex"` or `service_tier: "priority"`
- **THEN** the system computes cost using the published rates for that model and service tier

#### Scenario: GPT-5.6 long-context request uses published uplift

- **WHEN** a standard-tier or Flex GPT-5.6 request completes with more than 272K input tokens
- **THEN** the system computes cost using the published long-context input, cached-input, and output rates for that model and tier

### Requirement: API-key limit rule identities are unique

The system SHALL reject an API-key create or update payload when it contains
more than one limit rule with the same `(limit_type, limit_window,
model_filter)` identity. Rejection MUST use the typed API-key validation error
and MUST occur before a create request persists an API key or limit row.
The validation message MUST identify the duplicate rule identity.

#### Scenario: Duplicate rules are rejected during creation

- **WHEN** an administrator submits `POST /api/api-keys` with two limit rules
  sharing the same type, window, and model filter
- **THEN** the API returns `400` with `invalid_api_key_payload`
- **AND** no API key or limit row is persisted

### Requirement: Stale usage-reservation reclamation enforces a hard age ceiling

Stale usage-reservation reclamation MUST reclaim `reserved` reservations whose
age exceeds a hard ceiling on creation time regardless of how recently their
`updated_at` was refreshed. This is the backstop for orphaned reservation
heartbeats: a leaked heartbeat task keeps touching `updated_at`, which would
otherwise exempt its reservation from the heartbeat-based staleness cutoff
forever. The ceiling MUST be far larger than any legitimate request lifetime
so it can never reclaim an in-flight reservation, and reclamation past the
ceiling MUST restore the reserved quota the same way heartbeat-based
reclamation does.

#### Scenario: Orphaned heartbeat cannot exempt a reservation forever

- **GIVEN** a `reserved` usage reservation created before the hard age ceiling
- **AND** a leaked heartbeat keeps refreshing its `updated_at`
- **WHEN** stale usage-reservation reclamation runs
- **THEN** the reservation is released and its reserved quota is restored

#### Scenario: Fresh reservations are untouched by the ceiling

- **GIVEN** a `reserved` usage reservation created within the hard age ceiling
- **AND** its `updated_at` is current
- **WHEN** stale usage-reservation reclamation runs
- **THEN** the reservation stays `reserved`

### Requirement: API keys can enforce the Ultrafast service tier

The dashboard API key CRUD surface MUST accept and persist `ultrafast` as a canonical enforced service tier. The service MUST return the same canonical value and MUST NOT normalize it to `priority`.

#### Scenario: Create an API key with Ultrafast enforcement

- **WHEN** a dashboard client creates an API key with `enforcedServiceTier: "ultrafast"`
- **THEN** the request is accepted
- **AND** the persisted and returned enforced service tier is `ultrafast`

#### Scenario: Enforce Ultrafast on an advertising model

- **GIVEN** an account model advertises the `ultrafast` service tier
- **WHEN** a request uses an API key whose enforced service tier is `ultrafast`
- **THEN** the upstream request carries `service_tier: "ultrafast"`
