# account-routing Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-relative-availability-routing. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Relative availability routing

The proxy account selector SHALL support a `relative_availability` routing strategy. The strategy SHALL evaluate only accounts that have passed the existing eligibility, health-tier, model-plan, quota, cooldown, circuit-breaker, and budget-safety gates. Re-authentication-required accounts SHALL be treated as hard-blocked routing candidates, the same as paused and deactivated accounts. For each candidate, it SHALL compute a raw score from remaining secondary-window credits divided by seconds until the secondary-window reset, using bounded fallbacks for unknown or near-immediate reset times, and SHALL select from the highest weighted candidates according to the configured power and top-K cutoff.

#### Scenario: Soon-resetting usable credits are preferred
- **GIVEN** two healthy eligible accounts with equal remaining secondary credits
- **AND** one account's secondary window resets sooner
- **WHEN** account selection uses `relative_availability`
- **THEN** the sooner-resetting account receives the higher relative-availability score

#### Scenario: Relative availability preserves canonical gates
- **GIVEN** one account is paused, reauth-required, deactivated, rate-limited, quota-exceeded, cooling down, or outside the requested model plan
- **WHEN** account selection uses `relative_availability`
- **THEN** that account is not selected by the relative-availability strategy

### Requirement: Relative availability dashboard tuning
Dashboard settings SHALL expose `relative_availability_power` and `relative_availability_top_k` alongside the routing strategy. The backend SHALL validate power as positive and top-K as an integer from 1 through 20. The dashboard UI SHALL reject non-integer top-K input without truncating decimal values.

#### Scenario: Sticky fallback uses configured tuning
- **GIVEN** a sticky request has no usable pinned account
- **AND** relative-availability routing is enabled with non-default power or top-K settings
- **WHEN** the load balancer falls back to fresh selection
- **THEN** it applies the configured relative-availability power and top-K values

#### Scenario: Decimal top-K input is rejected
- **WHEN** an operator enters `1.5` for relative availability top-K
- **THEN** the dashboard does not enable saving that value as `1`

### Requirement: Relative availability logs avoid raw account emails
Relative-availability selection diagnostics SHALL identify accounts using stable internal account IDs or another non-PII identifier. They SHALL NOT emit raw account emails in candidate, top-K, winner, or hot-path selected-account logs.

#### Scenario: Candidate logs use account IDs
- **WHEN** relative-availability routing logs candidate or winner diagnostics
- **THEN** the log message includes the candidate account ID
- **AND** the log message does not include the account email address

### Requirement: Sequential drain routing
The proxy account selector SHALL support a `sequential_drain` routing strategy. The strategy SHALL evaluate only accounts that pass the existing eligibility, model-plan, quota, cooldown, circuit-breaker, and budget-safety gates, then select the usable account with the lowest effective secondary capacity before moving to higher-capacity accounts.

#### Scenario: Lowest-capacity usable account is drained first
- **GIVEN** multiple healthy eligible accounts with different effective secondary capacities
- **WHEN** account selection uses `sequential_drain`
- **THEN** the account with the lowest effective secondary capacity is selected

#### Scenario: Exhausted lower-capacity accounts are skipped
- **GIVEN** the lowest-capacity account has no usable quota
- **WHEN** account selection uses `sequential_drain`
- **THEN** the selector chooses the next-lowest usable capacity account

### Requirement: Reset drain routing
The proxy account selector SHALL support a `reset_drain` routing strategy. The strategy SHALL evaluate only accounts that pass the existing eligibility, model-plan, quota, cooldown, circuit-breaker, and budget-safety gates, then prefer usable accounts whose secondary quota reset is nearest. When secondary reset data is unavailable, it SHALL fall back to the primary reset time. Within the same reset bucket, it SHALL prefer the account with more remaining usable quota.

#### Scenario: Soonest resetting usable account is selected
- **GIVEN** multiple healthy eligible accounts with usable quota
- **AND** their secondary quota windows reset at different times
- **WHEN** account selection uses `reset_drain`
- **THEN** the usable account with the nearest secondary reset is selected

#### Scenario: Same-reset accounts drain higher remaining quota first
- **GIVEN** multiple healthy eligible accounts in the same reset bucket
- **WHEN** account selection uses `reset_drain`
- **THEN** the account with more remaining usable quota is selected

### Requirement: Single-account routing
The proxy routing layer SHALL support a `single_account` routing strategy configured by `single_account_id`. When enabled, the proxy SHALL route only through the configured account if that account exists, is available, and matches the requested model-plan scope. If the setting is missing, unavailable, or incompatible with the request, the proxy SHALL fail the request with a routing error instead of silently falling back to another account.

#### Scenario: Configured account serves matching traffic
- **GIVEN** `single_account` routing is enabled with a configured available account
- **AND** the account matches the requested model-plan scope
- **WHEN** the proxy selects an account
- **THEN** the configured account is selected

#### Scenario: Missing or unavailable selected account does not fall back
- **GIVEN** `single_account` routing is enabled
- **AND** the configured account is missing, unavailable, exhausted, or outside the requested model-plan scope
- **WHEN** the proxy selects an account
- **THEN** no alternate account is selected
- **AND** the request fails with a routing error

### Requirement: Drain routing dashboard settings
Dashboard settings SHALL expose `sequential_drain`, `reset_drain`, and `single_account` as valid routing strategies. When `single_account` is selected, the dashboard SHALL allow choosing the configured account id and the backend SHALL persist it as nullable `single_account_id`.

#### Scenario: Operator saves a single-account route
- **WHEN** an operator selects `single_account` and chooses an account
- **THEN** the settings API persists the selected account id
- **AND** subsequent settings responses include that id

### Requirement: Manual account routing policy

Each account SHALL have a persisted manual routing policy with one of `normal`, `burn_first`, or `preserve`. Missing or legacy values SHALL be treated as `normal`.

#### Scenario: expendable accounts are selected before normal accounts

- **GIVEN** at least one eligible account has routing policy `burn_first`
- **AND** at least one eligible account has routing policy `normal`
- **WHEN** the load balancer selects an account
- **THEN** it selects from the `burn_first` pool before considering `normal` accounts

#### Scenario: preserved accounts are fallback only

- **GIVEN** at least one eligible account has routing policy `normal`
- **AND** at least one eligible account has routing policy `preserve`
- **WHEN** the load balancer selects an account
- **THEN** it selects from the `normal` pool before considering `preserve` accounts

#### Scenario: routing policy does not bypass eligibility gates

- **GIVEN** a request is filtered by model plan or additional quota eligibility
- **WHEN** an account has routing policy `burn_first`
- **THEN** that account is still excluded if it fails the model plan or additional quota gate

### Requirement: Additional quota routing policy

Each known additional quota MAY have a routing policy of `inherit`, `normal`, `burn_first`, or `preserve`. `inherit` SHALL use the selected account's routing policy. The other values SHALL override account routing policy for requests gated by that additional quota.

For additional-quota-gated requests, account selection SHALL use fresh additional-quota usage windows for budget and reset comparison and SHALL NOT reject an account solely because its standard 5h or 7d quota is exhausted.

#### Scenario: additional quota inherits account policy

- **GIVEN** an additional quota has routing policy `inherit`
- **WHEN** the load balancer selects an account for that additional quota
- **THEN** it applies the account's own routing policy

#### Scenario: additional quota override takes precedence

- **GIVEN** an additional quota has routing policy `burn_first`
- **AND** an account with fresh available quota for that additional quota has standard Codex quota exhausted
- **WHEN** the load balancer selects an account for that additional quota
- **THEN** the account remains eligible and is treated as `burn_first` for that selection

### Requirement: Reset-window preference selection
When earlier-reset routing preference is enabled, the account selector SHALL
support choosing which quota window drives reset-time ordering. The supported
windows SHALL be `primary` and `secondary`. The default SHALL be `secondary` to
preserve existing behavior.

#### Scenario: Primary reset window is selected
- **GIVEN** two healthy eligible accounts with different primary reset times
- **AND** earlier-reset preference is enabled with reset window `primary`
- **WHEN** account selection evaluates otherwise comparable candidates
- **THEN** the account with the earlier primary reset is preferred

#### Scenario: Secondary reset window remains the default
- **GIVEN** earlier-reset preference is enabled without an explicit reset-window override
- **WHEN** account selection evaluates otherwise comparable candidates
- **THEN** the account selector uses secondary-window reset ordering

### Requirement: Reset-window preference propagation
All proxy account-selection surfaces SHALL pass the configured reset-window
preference into the canonical load balancer. This includes HTTP responses,
WebSocket responses, bridge requests, compact requests, transcription requests,
file-backed responses, Codex control requests, and sticky fallback selection.

#### Scenario: WebSocket selection uses the configured window
- **GIVEN** dashboard settings set the reset-window preference to `primary`
- **WHEN** a WebSocket response request selects an account
- **THEN** the load balancer receives `primary` as the reset-window preference

### Requirement: Foreground routing treats local usage snapshots as non-authoritative

Foreground proxy account selection MUST NOT reject an otherwise active account solely because local standard usage snapshots, synthetic planner costs, or inferred budget pressure report that the account has reached or exceeded 100 percent usage. Such local usage data MAY influence ranking, health/drain decisions, opportunistic burn policy, dashboards, and diagnostics, but it MUST NOT be reported as upstream rate limiting and MUST NOT produce `no_accounts` before an upstream attempt when no explicit local policy or local capacity guard is exhausted.

#### Scenario: Active account at local primary usage exhaustion is still selectable

- **GIVEN** an upstream account is persisted as active
- **AND** its latest local primary usage snapshot reports 100 percent usage with a future reset
- **WHEN** foreground account selection evaluates the account
- **THEN** the account remains eligible for upstream routing
- **AND** the selection result does not report a local `Rate limit exceeded` or `no_accounts` failure

#### Scenario: Active account at local secondary usage exhaustion is still selectable

- **GIVEN** an upstream account is persisted as active
- **AND** its latest local secondary usage snapshot reports 100 percent usage with a future reset
- **WHEN** foreground account selection evaluates the account
- **THEN** the account remains eligible for upstream routing
- **AND** the local secondary usage snapshot is not promoted into a persisted upstream quota-exceeded state before an upstream response proves quota exhaustion

#### Scenario: Advisory usage reset is not persisted as an account block

- **GIVEN** an upstream account is persisted as active
- **AND** its latest local usage snapshot reports 100 percent usage with a future reset
- **WHEN** foreground account selection evaluates and persists selection state for the active account
- **THEN** the account-level blocking reset remains unset
- **AND** a later upstream rate-limit response without reset metadata is governed by upstream retry/backoff cooldown rather than the advisory usage reset

### Requirement: Upstream rate and quota penalties are account-scoped by default

When upstream returns rate-limit or quota-exhaustion evidence for a selected account, the proxy MUST apply that penalty to the selected upstream account identity. The proxy MUST NOT invent model-scoped, transport-scoped, or request-kind-scoped upstream cooldown semantics unless upstream documentation or captured upstream response metadata proves that narrower upstream scope.

#### Scenario: Upstream 429 marks only the selected account

- **GIVEN** account A is selected for a request
- **AND** upstream returns a rate-limit response for that request
- **WHEN** the proxy records the penalty
- **THEN** it marks account A as rate-limited or cooling down
- **AND** it does not create model-scoped or transport-scoped upstream cooldown buckets without upstream evidence

### Requirement: Upstream rejections of the request payload are account neutral

When upstream rejects a request because of the request payload itself, the proxy MUST NOT mutate the selected account's health: it MUST NOT record a transient account error, a rate-limit penalty, a quota penalty, or a permanent failure for that account. An upstream failure qualifies as a payload rejection only when it would reproduce identically on every account. The proxy MUST decide membership from the classified upstream message, never from the `invalid_request_error` code alone, and MUST require the upstream HTTP status to be 400 whenever a status is known. An upstream missing-tool-output rejection — the `invalid_request_error` whose message identifies a tool call with no matching tool output — MUST qualify. An account-scoped `invalid_request_error`, including the model-entitlement rejection `The '<model>' model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account.`, MUST NOT qualify and MUST keep its existing account-health handling. Skipping the penalty MUST be logged so the decision is observable, and MUST NOT change the failure classification, the failover decision, or the status and body returned to the client.

#### Scenario: Missing-tool-output rejection leaves account health untouched

- **GIVEN** account A is selected for a request whose input references a tool call with no matching tool output
- **WHEN** upstream returns HTTP 400 `invalid_request_error` with a missing-tool-output message
- **THEN** the proxy does not increment account A's transient error count and does not mark it rate-limited, quota-exceeded, or permanently failed
- **AND** the failure is still classified `non_retryable` and surfaced to the client unchanged

#### Scenario: Repeated client payload rejection cannot starve unrelated sessions

- **GIVEN** one client repeatedly re-sends the same payload that upstream rejects for a missing tool output
- **WHEN** those requests are served by accounts shared with other sessions
- **THEN** no serving account enters error backoff because of that payload
- **AND** a session hard-pinned to one of those accounts is not failed with a saturated-hard-affinity selection error caused by that payload

#### Scenario: Model-entitlement rejection still penalizes the account

- **GIVEN** account A cannot use the requested model
- **WHEN** upstream returns HTTP 400 `invalid_request_error` stating the model is not supported for a ChatGPT account
- **THEN** the proxy records the account-health penalty for account A as before

### Requirement: Stale in-memory account sessions must not stay routable

The service MUST remove accounts from routing when they are paused, deleted,
marked `reauth_required`, or otherwise made unavailable by a permanent
credential/session failure. This applies even when a long-lived in-memory HTTP
bridge session still holds an older `ACTIVE` account object. When the account
is successfully imported, re-authenticated, or reactivated, the service MUST
clear the in-memory unavailable marker. The routing-unavailable state MUST be
derived from persisted account status and MUST converge on every replica
within the cache-invalidation bus bound (marks and clears both propagate);
bridge-session reuse checks MUST NOT add per-request database reads; sessions
pinned to a deleted account MUST NOT be reused on any replica. A local
unavailable mark set while a snapshot refresh is in flight MUST survive that
refresh: a refresh MUST NOT clear marks it could not have observed as committed
status when its database read started.

#### Scenario: Stale bridge session is not reused after account becomes unavailable

- **GIVEN** an HTTP bridge session was created while account A was active
- **AND** account A is later marked unavailable for routing
- **WHEN** a subsequent bridge request looks for a reusable session
- **THEN** the stale session for account A is not reused

#### Scenario: Re-authentication clears routing-unavailable state

- **GIVEN** account A was marked unavailable after a credential/session failure,
  including on a replica other than the one handling the re-authentication
- **WHEN** account A is re-authenticated successfully
- **THEN** account A is eligible for routing again subject to normal account
  selection gates on every replica after the invalidation bus converges,
  without requiring a process restart

#### Scenario: Pause on one replica stops bridge-session reuse on peers

- **GIVEN** replica B holds a warm HTTP bridge session pinned to account A whose in-memory snapshot reads `ACTIVE`
- **WHEN** account A is paused via a request served by replica A
- **THEN** after the invalidation bus converges, replica B refuses to reuse the warm bridge session for account A

#### Scenario: Local mark set during an in-flight snapshot refresh is preserved

- **GIVEN** a routing snapshot refresh is in flight and its database read observed
  account A as `ACTIVE` before a permanent failure was committed
- **WHEN** account A is marked routing-unavailable locally before that refresh
  finishes
- **THEN** the completed refresh MUST NOT drop the local mark based on its stale
  snapshot, and account A remains routing-unavailable on that replica until a
  later refresh observes a committed routable status

#### Scenario: Deletion on one replica stops bridge-session reuse on peers

- **GIVEN** replica B holds a warm HTTP bridge session pinned to account A whose in-memory snapshot reads `ACTIVE`
- **WHEN** account A is deleted via a request served by replica A
- **THEN** after the invalidation bus converges, replica B treats account A as routing-unavailable even though its in-memory account object still reads `ACTIVE`

### Requirement: Upstream rate-limit cooldown honors the Retry-After hint duration

The account cooldown SHALL last for the full duration expressed by a "try
again in" hint on an upstream rate-limit error. The parser SHALL
recognize hour, minute, second, and millisecond units, including their word
forms, and SHALL sum compound hints such as `1h2m3s` into a single duration.
A unit token SHALL be recognized only when it is not immediately followed by
another letter, so an unsupported longer word whose prefix matches a unit (for
example `month`, where `m` prefixes the word) is not mis-read as that shorter
unit. When the hint contains no recognizable unit token, the system SHALL fall
back to the error-count backoff schedule. A rate-limited account SHALL NOT be
re-selected before its cooldown elapses.

Explicit upstream reset metadata SHALL be accepted only when it resolves to a
finite deadline strictly later than the current time and no more than
`RATE_LIMIT_RESET_MAX_HORIZON_SECONDS` (366 days) in the future. `resets_at`
SHALL be interpreted as an absolute Unix timestamp and `resets_in_seconds`
SHALL be interpreted as a relative duration. When `resets_at` is invalid but
`resets_in_seconds` is valid, the relative duration SHALL be used. An accepted
fractional deadline SHALL be rounded up to the next whole second before
persistence. A persisted integer deadline produced by that rounding MAY be
less than one second beyond the raw 366-day horizon and MUST remain valid when
selection reconstructs it. When neither field is valid, the error SHALL be
treated as carrying no explicit reset metadata.

When the upstream rate-limit error carries no valid explicit reset metadata,
the resolved cooldown deadline SHALL be persisted on the account row
(`reset_at`) so the cooldown survives process restarts and is visible to all
replicas sharing the database: a parsed Retry-After hint deadline SHALL be
persisted rounded up to the next whole second (persistence stores `reset_at`
as an integer, so a short or fractional hint MUST NOT truncate down to an
already-elapsed deadline), and when the cooldown comes from the error-count
backoff fallback the persisted deadline SHALL be at least
`RATE_LIMITED_MIN_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` (30 seconds) in the future. The marking
replica's in-process cooldown MAY remain shorter than the persisted deadline
so its existing fresh-usage recovery gate is unchanged.

An already-persisted `rate_limited` reset deadline beyond the same plausibility
horizon SHALL be treated as missing metadata rather than as an unexpired
cooldown. A row carrying `blocked_at` SHALL still honor the existing 30-second
minimum floor and SHALL require recent usage evidence recorded after that block
before selection-time recovery may clear it. A row without `blocked_at` SHALL
require recent available usage evidence. In both cases, every applicable
derived quota window MUST report below `100%` usage before recovery.

#### Scenario: Compound minute-and-second hint sets the full cooldown

- **GIVEN** an upstream 429 whose message says "try again in 6m0s"
- **WHEN** the balancer records the rate limit for the account
- **THEN** the account cooldown lasts 360 seconds
- **AND** the account is not re-selected until its cooldown elapses

#### Scenario: Minutes-only hint is honored

- **GIVEN** an upstream 429 whose message says "try again in 20m"
- **WHEN** the balancer records the rate limit for the account
- **THEN** the account cooldown lasts 1200 seconds

#### Scenario: Unparseable hint falls back to backoff

- **GIVEN** an upstream 429 whose message has no recognizable "try again in" duration
- **WHEN** the balancer records the rate limit for the account
- **THEN** the cooldown uses the error-count backoff schedule instead

#### Scenario: Unsupported longer word is not mis-read as a shorter unit

- **GIVEN** an upstream 429 whose message says "try again in 1 month"
- **WHEN** the balancer records the rate limit for the account
- **THEN** the `month` token is not read as a 1-minute hint
- **AND** the cooldown uses the error-count backoff schedule instead

#### Scenario: Cooldown without upstream reset metadata is persisted

- **GIVEN** an upstream 429 that carries no `resets_at`/`resets_in_seconds` metadata and no parseable Retry-After hint
- **WHEN** the balancer records the rate limit for the account
- **THEN** the persisted account row holds status `RATE_LIMITED` with `blocked_at` set
- **AND** the persisted `reset_at` is at least 30 seconds in the future

#### Scenario: Retry-After hint deadline is persisted

- **GIVEN** an upstream 429 whose message says "try again in 20m" and that carries no reset metadata
- **WHEN** the balancer records the rate limit for the account
- **THEN** the persisted `reset_at` is approximately 1200 seconds in the future

#### Scenario: Short fractional Retry-After hint is not truncated away

- **GIVEN** an upstream 429 whose message says "try again in 500ms" and that carries no reset metadata
- **WHEN** the balancer records the rate limit for the account
- **THEN** the persisted integer `reset_at` deadline is strictly in the future
- **AND** peer replicas honor the hinted cooldown instead of reselecting the account immediately

#### Scenario: Plausible explicit reset metadata remains authoritative

- **GIVEN** an OpenAI service 429 carrying a finite `resets_at` deadline 30 days in the future
- **WHEN** the balancer records the rate limit for the account
- **THEN** the accepted explicit deadline is persisted
- **AND** the Retry-After/backoff fallback does not replace it

#### Scenario: Implausible explicit reset metadata uses the bounded fallback

- **GIVEN** an OpenAI service 429 carrying `resets_at=15023672358` while the current Unix time is approximately `1784146959`
- **AND** the error carries no valid `resets_in_seconds` or parseable duration
- **WHEN** the balancer records the rate limit for the account
- **THEN** the implausible absolute deadline is rejected
- **AND** the persisted deadline uses the minimum bounded backoff instead

#### Scenario: Valid relative metadata survives an invalid absolute value

- **GIVEN** an OpenAI service 429 whose `resets_at` is implausibly far in the future
- **AND** whose `resets_in_seconds` is a finite positive duration within 366 days
- **WHEN** the balancer records the rate limit for the account
- **THEN** the relative duration determines the persisted deadline

#### Scenario: Horizon-edge rounding remains stable

- **GIVEN** valid absolute or relative reset metadata resolves exactly 366 days after a fractional current timestamp
- **WHEN** the balancer rounds and persists the deadline to a whole second
- **THEN** persisted-state reconstruction continues to accept that deadline
- **AND** does not clear the cooldown solely because rounding crossed the raw horizon by less than one second

#### Scenario: Existing implausible deadline does not pin selection indefinitely

- **GIVEN** a persisted `rate_limited` account whose `reset_at` is more than 366 days in the future
- **AND** whose `blocked_at` minimum floor has elapsed
- **WHEN** selection reconstructs the account from fresh available usage evidence
- **THEN** the implausible deadline is treated as missing metadata
- **AND** normal compare-and-set recovery may restore the account to `active`

#### Scenario: Exhausted long-window quota prevents poisoned-row recovery

- **GIVEN** a persisted `rate_limited` account whose reset deadline is implausible
- **AND** a fresh primary window reports available quota
- **AND** an applicable weekly or monthly window reports `100%` usage
- **WHEN** selection reconstructs the account
- **THEN** the account remains `rate_limited`

#### Scenario: Implausible legacy deadline without a block marker recovers

- **GIVEN** a persisted `rate_limited` account whose reset deadline is implausible
- **AND** the row has no `blocked_at` marker
- **WHEN** selection reconstructs the account from recent available usage in every applicable window
- **THEN** normal compare-and-set recovery may restore the account to `active`

### Requirement: Re-authentication-required accounts are not selectable

When an account credential/session is invalidated but the upstream account is not known to be disabled, the system MUST mark the account `reauth_required`. The selector MUST remove `reauth_required` accounts from every routing strategy and hard-affinity fallback until the account is re-authenticated. Operator pickers that configure single-account routing or account-scoped routing MUST only offer accounts that are not hard-blocked by paused, reauth-required, or deactivated status.

#### Scenario: Token invalidated account leaves the pool

- **GIVEN** account A is `reauth_required`
- **AND** account B is active
- **WHEN** a proxy request selects an account
- **THEN** account B is selected
- **AND** account A is not considered an eligible candidate

#### Scenario: Hard-blocked account cannot be newly selected for scoped routing

- **GIVEN** account A is paused, reauth-required, or deactivated
- **WHEN** an operator opens a scoped account-routing picker
- **THEN** account A is not offered as a new selectable account

#### Scenario: Re-authentication-required account cannot be paused into resumable state

- **GIVEN** account A is `reauth_required`
- **WHEN** an operator attempts to pause account A
- **THEN** the request is rejected
- **AND** account A remains `reauth_required`

### Requirement: Selection state expires elapsed usage windows

When building account selection state, the proxy SHALL treat any main-window usage sample (primary or secondary) whose `reset_at` timestamp has elapsed as a reset window: the derived used percentage becomes `0.0` and the derived reset timestamp is cleared, regardless of the sample's recorded used percentage. The rule SHALL apply after weekly-only primary remapping and SHALL mutate only derived selection inputs, not stored usage rows. Expired samples SHALL map to `0.0` rather than unknown so usage-derived status recovery still evaluates.

#### Scenario: Stale sub-100% primary sample stops gating selection

- **GIVEN** upstream stopped reporting a primary window for an account
- **AND** the account's last stored primary row reports 87% used with an elapsed `reset_at`
- **WHEN** selection state is built for that account
- **THEN** the derived primary usage is `0.0` with no reset timestamp
- **AND** the sample no longer holds the account in the soft-drain tier or above sticky budget-safety thresholds

#### Scenario: Expired sample still allows blocked-status recovery

- **GIVEN** an account persisted as `rate_limited` whose usage sample has an elapsed `reset_at`
- **WHEN** selection state is built for that account
- **THEN** the expired sample evaluates as `0.0` used rather than unknown
- **AND** usage-derived status recovery can still return the account to `active`

#### Scenario: Weekly-only remap happens before expiry

- **GIVEN** an account whose payload reports only a weekly window in the primary slot
- **WHEN** selection state is built
- **THEN** the weekly-primary remap into the secondary slot is evaluated on the raw samples
- **AND** the elapsed-reset expiry applies to the remapped derived values

### Requirement: Rate-limit cooldowns are enforced across replicas

A replica that did not observe the upstream 429 MUST NOT transition a
`RATE_LIMITED` account to `ACTIVE` while the persisted `reset_at` deadline is
in the future, regardless of the account's recorded usage. For `RATE_LIMITED`
rows with `blocked_at` set but no persisted `reset_at` (legacy rows written
before cooldown persistence), replicas MUST hold the account `RATE_LIMITED`
until at least `blocked_at + RATE_LIMITED_MIN_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`. Recovery
transitions MUST be written through the compare-and-set status update
(`update_status_if_current`) so a stale snapshot cannot clobber a newer
marking.

This constraint applies to every recovery path that writes account status,
including the usage-refresh reconcile path: a usage refresh that observes
available quota for a `RATE_LIMITED` account with `blocked_at` set MUST NOT
rewrite the account to `ACTIVE` (or clear `reset_at`/`blocked_at`) while the
persisted cooldown deadline — `reset_at`, or the
`blocked_at + RATE_LIMITED_MIN_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` floor when `reset_at` is
NULL — is still in the future. Only the replica that observed the 429 MAY
recover the account earlier, through its runtime-cooldown-gated fresh-usage
path; a replica's runtime cooldown state counts as observing the current 429
only when its runtime block marker is at least as recent as the effective
persisted `blocked_at` — leftover runtime state from an earlier 429 MUST NOT
unlock early recovery of a newer block. `RATE_LIMITED` rows without
`blocked_at` (stale window-derived markings) keep the existing fresh-usage
recovery.

#### Scenario: Usage refresh does not clear a running Retry-After cooldown

- **GIVEN** an account marked `RATE_LIMITED` by a 429 whose Retry-After hint persisted `reset_at` 20 minutes in the future and `blocked_at` set
- **WHEN** a periodic usage refresh fetches fresh usage showing available quota before that deadline
- **THEN** the persisted row keeps status `RATE_LIMITED` with its `reset_at` and `blocked_at` intact
- **AND** once the deadline elapses, a later refresh may recover the account to `ACTIVE` through the compare-and-set path

#### Scenario: Peer replica does not flip a cooling account back

- **GIVEN** balancer instance A marked account X `RATE_LIMITED` from a 429 with no reset metadata
- **AND** account X's recorded usage is below 100%
- **WHEN** a second balancer instance sharing the same database runs account selection
- **THEN** account X is not selected
- **AND** the persisted row remains `RATE_LIMITED` with its `reset_at` deadline intact until the deadline elapses

#### Scenario: Stale runtime cooldown does not unlock early recovery of a newer block

- **GIVEN** a replica holds expired runtime cooldown state left over from an earlier 429 of account X
- **AND** account X was since re-marked `RATE_LIMITED` by a peer replica with a newer `blocked_at` and a future persisted `reset_at`
- **WHEN** the replica evaluates account X with usage recorded after the newer `blocked_at`
- **THEN** account X stays `RATE_LIMITED` and is not selected until the persisted deadline elapses

#### Scenario: Legacy row without reset_at is floored

- **GIVEN** a persisted `RATE_LIMITED` row with `blocked_at` five seconds ago and `reset_at` NULL
- **WHEN** a fresh balancer instance evaluates it during selection
- **THEN** the account stays `RATE_LIMITED` and is not selected
- **AND** once the 30-second floor has elapsed, recovery back to `ACTIVE` is permitted through the compare-and-set path

### Requirement: Transient balancer health signals are replica-local

Transient error counts, error-backoff windows, drain/probe health tiers, probe success streaks, and in-flight/lease pressure SHALL be maintained per replica
as advisory routing state and SHALL NOT require cross-replica agreement;
persisted account status, `reset_at`, and `blocked_at` transitions are the
only cross-replica health signals. Each replica SHALL converge on its own
observations.

#### Scenario: Peer may route to an account draining elsewhere

- **GIVEN** replica A has drained account X after locally observed transient errors
- **WHEN** replica B, which has recorded no errors for X, performs selection
- **THEN** replica B may select account X
- **AND** replica B backs off independently once its own error threshold for X is reached

### Requirement: Round-robin tie-breaking is decorrelated across replicas

The `round_robin` routing strategy SHALL order candidate accounts primarily by
planner cost and then by least-recently-selected time, and SHALL break any
remaining exact tie using a per-replica salt mixed into the account identifier
through a keyed hash. The salt SHALL be stable for the lifetime of a replica
process (not randomized per selection), SHALL default to the replica's HTTP
responses-session bridge instance identity, and SHALL fall back to the host
identity when no bridge instance identity is configured. Mixing the salt SHALL
change only the final tie-break: the planner-cost and least-recently-selected
ordering SHALL remain identical to selection without a salt, so only genuinely
tied candidates are reordered.

#### Scenario: Replicas with distinct salts spread an exact tie

- **GIVEN** two or more healthy eligible accounts that are exactly tied on
  planner cost and least-recently-selected time
- **AND** two replicas configured with distinct per-replica salts
- **WHEN** each replica selects with the `round_robin` strategy
- **THEN** the replicas MAY break the tie toward different accounts so load
  spreads across the equally-good candidates instead of herding onto one

#### Scenario: Primary ordering is unaffected by the salt

- **GIVEN** candidate accounts that differ in planner cost or
  least-recently-selected time
- **WHEN** account selection uses the `round_robin` strategy under any salt
- **THEN** the account with the lower planner cost, or when costs are equal the
  least-recently-selected account, is selected regardless of the salt value

#### Scenario: Single-replica selection is deterministic

- **GIVEN** a fixed set of candidate accounts and a fixed per-replica salt
- **WHEN** the `round_robin` strategy selects repeatedly with unchanged state
- **THEN** the same account is selected every time

### Requirement: Probing accounts receive bounded recovery admission

For routing strategies that use the health-tier candidate pool, the load balancer MUST give replica-local `PROBING` accounts bounded opportunities to receive recovery traffic while healthy accounts remain. A probing account MUST become due when it has never been selected or at least the fixed probe quiet interval has elapsed since its last selection. When one or more probing accounts are due, selection MUST admit only the oldest-due probing account, using account id as a stable tie-break, ahead of the healthy pool for that selection. An unbound sticky selection or a sticky selection that can fall back from its existing owner MUST reserve that admission in replica-local runtime state before releasing the runtime lock for sticky repository work, so concurrent requests cannot consume the same due interval. The reservation MUST retain both its timestamp token and the runtime version captured at reservation. It MUST remain provisional through selection-time sticky repository work, the final local lease check, and selection-state persistence, and MUST be committed only if both captured values remain current when selection returns the probing account. If either value becomes stale, selection MUST release the reservation and retry without returning the stale probe. Sticky delete or upsert decisions made during selection MUST remain provisional through hard-sticky cap classification, final lease admission, selection-state persistence, and the probe reservation commit when applicable. Every other outcome MUST release the reservation without consuming the interval. Provisional reserve/release operations MUST NOT advance the runtime health-observation version used to reject stale Force Probe settlement; a committed recovery admission MUST advance it. When no probing account is due, healthy-first ordering MUST remain unchanged.

Recovery admission MUST occur only after all ordinary account eligibility, cooldown, model, security, quota, and local account-cap gates, but before budget and `burn_first`/`normal`/`preserve` preference shortcuts that could otherwise mask the due account. A hard-sticky owner MAY remain in the candidate set despite its local account cap solely to preserve fail-closed ownership, but every wider fallback candidate MUST pass the cap gate. When every otherwise available fallback is cap-filtered, an unavailable but under-cap fallback MUST NOT suppress the stable local account-cap error or be selected through transient-backoff fallback. Non-cap availability before and after cap filtering MUST be evaluated over each complete fallback pool so cross-account opportunistic eligibility is preserved, and an established local cap error MUST NOT be replaced by the opportunistic burn-window error. Returning a local cap error MUST preserve the existing hard-sticky owner mapping without deleting or rebinding it. Recovery admission MUST NOT displace a selectable existing sticky owner merely to probe another account, and it MUST NOT change the behavior of routing strategies that intentionally bypass health-tier pool ordering.

#### Scenario: Due probing account progresses while a healthy account exists

- **GIVEN** one eligible healthy account and one eligible probing account whose last selection is older than the fixed probe quiet interval
- **WHEN** an unbound health-tier-aware selection occurs
- **THEN** the probing account is selected for one recovery attempt
- **AND** its selection timestamp prevents another bounded recovery admission until the quiet interval elapses again

#### Scenario: Recent probing account does not displace healthy routing

- **GIVEN** one eligible healthy account and one eligible probing account selected less than the fixed probe quiet interval ago
- **WHEN** health-tier-aware selection occurs
- **THEN** the healthy account is selected

#### Scenario: Routing policy cannot starve a due probe

- **GIVEN** an eligible probing account is due while a healthy `burn_first` or non-preserved account remains
- **WHEN** health-tier-aware selection applies routing-policy preferences
- **THEN** the due probing account receives the bounded recovery admission before those preferences

#### Scenario: Oldest due probing account rotates fairly

- **GIVEN** multiple eligible probing accounts are due while healthy accounts remain
- **WHEN** health-tier-aware selection occurs
- **THEN** only the probing account with the oldest selection timestamp is admitted
- **AND** account id deterministically breaks an exact timestamp tie

#### Scenario: Existing sticky owner is retained

- **GIVEN** a request has a selectable sticky owner on a healthy account
- **AND** another account is due for probing recovery
- **WHEN** sticky selection occurs
- **THEN** the existing owner remains selected
- **AND** the sticky mapping is not rebound for recovery sampling

#### Scenario: Concurrent unbound stickies share one recovery admission

- **GIVEN** a probing account is due while a healthy account remains
- **AND** multiple requests concurrently observe distinct sticky keys with no existing owner
- **WHEN** those requests perform sticky selection
- **THEN** at most one request selects the due probing account for that quiet interval
- **AND** the other requests observe the reservation and retain healthy-first routing

#### Scenario: Concurrent sticky fallbacks share one recovery admission

- **GIVEN** a probing account is due while a healthy account remains
- **AND** multiple sticky requests have existing owners that are temporarily unavailable
- **WHEN** those requests concurrently select from the wider fallback pool
- **THEN** at most one request selects the due probing account for that quiet interval
- **AND** the other fallback requests observe the reservation and retain healthy-first routing

#### Scenario: Lease race releases a provisional probe admission

- **GIVEN** a sticky request reserves a due probing account while it performs sticky persistence
- **AND** another request fills that account's local concurrency cap before the final lease check
- **WHEN** the reserving request rejects the probing account and selects or reports another outcome
- **THEN** the probing account's prior selection timestamp is restored
- **AND** the quiet interval is not consumed by traffic that was never admitted

#### Scenario: Released reservation does not invalidate Force Probe settlement

- **GIVEN** an accepted Force Probe is loading usage for a probing account
- **AND** a concurrent sticky request reserves and then releases that probing account without selecting it
- **WHEN** the Force Probe settles against otherwise unchanged runtime health
- **THEN** its success is not rejected as stale because of the provisional reservation
- **AND** reserve/release does not advance the runtime health-observation version

#### Scenario: Newer health observation invalidates a sticky probe reservation

- **GIVEN** a sticky request reserves a due probing account and begins sticky repository work
- **AND** a newer runtime health observation advances that account's version and changes its health tier before admission commits
- **WHEN** the stale sticky selection attempts to return the reserved probing account
- **THEN** selection releases the reservation and retries against the newer runtime state
- **AND** it does not return the stale probe or persist sticky affinity to it

#### Scenario: Saturated probing account is excluded from sticky fallback

- **GIVEN** a hard-sticky owner is temporarily unavailable
- **AND** a due probing fallback account is at its local concurrency cap
- **AND** an eligible healthy fallback remains below its cap
- **WHEN** sticky fallback selection occurs
- **THEN** the saturated probing account is excluded from the fallback pool
- **AND** the healthy account is selected without rebinding the sticky mapping to the saturated account

#### Scenario: Saturated-only sticky fallback reports local cap pressure

- **GIVEN** a hard-sticky owner is temporarily unavailable
- **AND** every wider fallback account is at its local concurrency cap
- **WHEN** sticky fallback selection cannot retain the owner
- **THEN** selection returns the stable local account-cap error
- **AND** it does not report global upstream unavailability or delete or rebind the sticky mapping

#### Scenario: Unavailable under-cap fallback does not mask cap pressure

- **GIVEN** a hard-sticky owner is temporarily unavailable
- **AND** every otherwise available wider fallback is at its local concurrency cap
- **AND** another wider fallback is under cap but unavailable because of quota, rate limit, cooldown, or account status
- **WHEN** sticky fallback selection cannot retain the owner
- **THEN** selection returns the stable local account-cap error
- **AND** the unavailable under-cap fallback does not cause global upstream-unavailability classification

#### Scenario: Opportunistic fallback cap pressure is classified over the complete pool

- **GIVEN** a hard-sticky owner is temporarily unavailable
- **AND** multiple wider fallbacks are opportunistically eligible when evaluated together
- **AND** every such fallback is at its local concurrency cap
- **WHEN** opportunistic sticky fallback selection cannot retain the owner
- **THEN** selection returns the stable local account-cap error
- **AND** it does not replace that reason with the opportunistic burn-window error

#### Scenario: Backoff-only fallback does not bypass local cap pressure

- **GIVEN** a hard-sticky owner is temporarily unavailable
- **AND** every normally usable wider fallback is at its local concurrency cap
- **AND** another under-cap fallback is still in transient error backoff
- **WHEN** sticky fallback selection evaluates the post-cap pool
- **THEN** it returns the stable local account-cap error
- **AND** it does not select or bind the backoff-only fallback

#### Scenario: Cap classification discards a provisional sticky deletion

- **GIVEN** an unavailable hard-sticky owner would otherwise be reallocated because of budget pressure
- **AND** every normally usable wider fallback is at its local concurrency cap
- **WHEN** selection finalizes the stable local account-cap error
- **THEN** any provisional delete or rebind decision is discarded
- **AND** the existing hard-sticky owner mapping remains unchanged

### Requirement: Trusted cyber intent narrows the existing account pool

Account routing MUST constrain an authenticated direct Responses WebSocket
turn requiring `trusted_cyber` by passing
`require_security_work_authorized=True` to the canonical selector before the
first upstream attempt and every later retry. The selector MUST apply the
constraint only to accounts already permitted by API-key, account, model,
service-tier, ownership, health, quota, affinity, concurrency, and failover
rules. Routing MUST NOT add an account, change the configured strategy, rebind
an owner, or fall back to an ordinary account.

#### Scenario: First attempt uses the capable pool
- **WHEN** an authenticated direct WebSocket turn establishes `trusted_cyber`
- **THEN** its first account-selection call requires a
  security-work-authorized account
- **AND** no ordinary account receives an upstream attempt

#### Scenario: Empty capable pool fails closed
- **WHEN** a required turn has no eligible security-work-authorized account
- **THEN** selection returns the existing typed
  `no_security_work_authorized_accounts` error
- **AND** its advisory states that no ordinary-account fallback occurred
- **AND** an earlier reactive or account/model error cannot replace that typed
  capability-routing result
- **AND** ordinary routing is not attempted

#### Scenario: Ordinary routing is unchanged
- **WHEN** an authenticated direct WebSocket turn has neither a trusted signal
  nor required lineage
- **THEN** selection receives the same scope, strategy, ownership, admission,
  and retry inputs as before this change
