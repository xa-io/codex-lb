# Context: frontend-architecture

Normative requirements live in [`spec.md`](./spec.md). This document currently
covers the progressive-disclosure navigation and settings model.

## Progressive disclosure (nav + settings)

### Purpose

Part of the simplicity effort (PRINCIPLES.md P3, progressive disclosure): keep
the first-run dashboard surface small — import accounts, hand out an API key,
point a client at the proxy — while every power feature stays one explicit
interaction away.

### Decisions

- **Core vs Advanced split.** Nav: Dashboard, Reports, Accounts, APIs,
  Settings are core; Automations (scheduled warm-up jobs) is the only advanced
  destination today. Settings: Appearance, Import, Guest Access, Password,
  Session, TOTP, and API Keys stay flat; Routing tuning, Upstream Proxy pools,
  Model Sources, Firewall, Quota Planner, and Sticky Sessions collapse into
  the Advanced group.
- **One-item Advanced menu is intentional, not over-engineering.** The menu is
  the mandated landing zone for future power features per PRINCIPLES.md P3: a
  new page-level destination defaults to the Advanced menu unless a spec
  explicitly designates it core.
- **Advanced sections fetch on expand, not on page load — intentional.** The
  Advanced settings group unmounts its children while collapsed (Radix
  Collapsible default, no `forceMount`). Sections that issue queries on mount
  (firewall entries, quota planner, sticky sessions, model sources) therefore
  do not fire network requests when an operator merely opens `/settings`; the
  requests fire on the first expand. This trims first-paint work for the
  common path and must not be flagged as a data-loading regression.
- **Arrays stay in `app-header.tsx`.** `CORE_NAV_ITEMS` and
  `ADVANCED_NAV_ITEMS` are flat `as const` arrays in the header component (no
  separate nav-items module); the CI simplicity budget manifest
  (`.github/simplicity-budgets.toml`, `[core_nav]`) points at this file.
- **No new routes.** `/automations` deep links stay as-is. The legacy
  `/firewall` compatibility route redirects to `/settings?advanced=1#firewall`
  so Advanced expands and the firewall section is in view; plain `/settings`
  stays collapsed by default. Regression tests cover both.

### Example

A read-only guest opens `/settings`: they see Appearance, Import, and API Keys
cards plus a collapsed "Advanced settings" row. No firewall/quota/sticky-session
requests have been issued. One click on the row mounts all six advanced
sections with their controls disabled by the existing `canWrite` gating.

### Testing notes

- Tests that asserted advanced sections on load (settings-page unit test,
  firewall integration flow, header Automations link) expand/open first —
  asserting through the same one-interaction path an operator uses.
- The accounts reset-credits badge stays on the core Accounts item in both
  desktop and mobile navs.

## Dashboard partial-failure isolation

### Purpose and scope

The dashboard overview and request-log listing are independent operator surfaces. A request-log storage or listing outage should not remove healthy fleet quota and account controls. Normative behavior lives in [`spec.md`](./spec.md); while the change is active, its added requirement lives in [`../../changes/preserve-dashboard-overview-on-log-failure/specs/frontend-architecture/spec.md`](../../changes/preserve-dashboard-overview-on-log-failure/specs/frontend-architecture/spec.md).

### Decision rationale

The page composes overview-backed view data as soon as overview data exists and treats request logs as a section-local state machine: initial loading, terminal error announced through a local alert semantic, or ready. Recovery calls the existing request-log query's local refetch operation. A broader dashboard invalidation was rejected because it would refetch healthy data and could make usable incident context disappear.

### Constraints and non-goals

This boundary does not change API shapes, query keys, retry policy, polling, or backend reliability. It does not preserve stale rows after later refetch failures, introduce route splitting or global state, or define global live-region behavior. The header refresh action intentionally keeps its existing broad refresh semantics; only the Request Logs Retry action is local.

### Failure mode and example

If overview, projections, and request-log options return successfully while the initial listing reaches terminal HTTP 500, operators continue to see statistics, quota charts, and account controls. The Request Logs heading remains visible with a locally announced endpoint error and native Retry control. After the endpoint recovers, keyboard-activating Retry replaces that error with the returned rows without issuing another overview request.

### Testing notes

The product-boundary regression renders the real `/dashboard` App route with the production query retry policy and MSW handlers. It counts each request family, seeds unique values for a statistic, quota surface, projection metric, and account control, focuses and keyboard-activates native Retry, holds the recovered listing response pending long enough to assert all healthy surfaces remain mounted, and then verifies the recovered row.
