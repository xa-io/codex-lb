# Context: user-documentation

Normative requirements live in [`spec.md`](./spec.md). This document carries the
rationale and operational notes for the docs site and entry-point documents.

## Purpose

Restore the founding "1-click setup" promise of the entry-point documents. The
README had grown to 653 lines and `.env.example` to 115 lines / ~45 active
values; both buried the quickstart. Detailed material now has a real home (the
published mkdocs-material site at https://soju06.github.io/codex-lb/) so the
README and sample env stay slim without losing content.

## Decisions

- **mkdocs-material, docs at `docs/` root.** `docs_dir: docs` means the
  existing `docs/screenshots/` images ship into the site unchanged and README
  image paths keep working on GitHub. Pages live directly under `docs/` (not
  `docs/content/`) so the site homepage is
  `https://soju06.github.io/codex-lb/` itself.
- **Strict build as the docs gate.** The `validation:` block in `mkdocs.yml`
  plus `--strict` turns broken internal links, missing anchors, and
  nav-orphaned pages into CI failures. Corollary: any stray `.md` dropped into
  `docs/` breaks the build — keep scratch notes out.
- **`--only-group docs`** keeps the docs build from installing the app
  dependency tree; `uv run --no-sync` stops the run step from re-syncing to the
  dev defaults. The `docs` group is not in uv default-groups, so `make test`
  and friends do not pull mkdocs.
- **Deploy only from main, never cancel in-flight.** PR runs stop after the
  strict build; push runs upload the Pages artifact and deploy via
  `actions/deploy-pages` (`build_type=workflow`).
- **README keeps exactly one client path inline** (Codex CLI `config.toml`) —
  the most common client — with a table linking the rest. No badges; a single
  prominent documentation link line instead (locked decision).
- **all-contributors block stays in README.md** between its markers; the
  generated table is bot-managed and is not hand-written complexity.
- **`.env.example` drift values were deleted, not corrected.** The sample is
  all-commented so it can never drift into behavior changes again. The
  commented `# CODEX_LB_LEADER_ELECTION_ENABLED=false` escape hatch is pinned
  by `tests/unit/test_helm_replica_artifacts.py`.
- **OpenSpec stays normative.** Docs pages carry footer links to their
  governing capability; they render behavior, they do not define it.
- **Community companions stay separate.** Small operator tools that consume an
  existing API can be maintained in independent repositories and linked from
  the docs once they are public and tested. A listing keeps the tool
  discoverable without adding its runtime, CI, release process, or support
  surface to codex-lb. The first listings cover the independently published
  [Codex LB Status Bar](https://github.com/sm1ee/codex-lb-statusbar) and the
  read-only
  [codex-lb SwiftBar](https://github.com/joschi655/codex-lb-swiftbar),
  following the maintainer direction in
  [PR #1233](https://github.com/Soju06/codex-lb/pull/1233#issuecomment-4988227303).
  Listings also carry least-privilege guidance: guest access for monitoring
  where the companion supports it, and admin access only for control features;
  each companion remains responsible for documenting its current auth modes.
  Placement: the listing renders as an appendix-level section at the end of
  `docs/index.md` (below core usage and screenshots) and is kept
  self-contained so it can move to a dedicated page once the list grows; a
  short mirror lives in the README under the Documentation section (a
  sub-heading, not a new top-level README section, per the simplicity
  budgets).
- **zh-CN README gets a canonical-English banner** rather than a parallel diet;
  full i18n (mkdocs-static-i18n) is a deferred follow-up.

## Constraints / failure modes

- GitHub Pages must be enabled out-of-band by an admin
  (`gh api -X POST repos/Soju06/codex-lb/pages -f build_type=workflow`) before
  the first `main` deploy; until then the deploy job fails while the build
  check still protects PRs.
- `uv.lock` must be regenerated whenever the `docs` group changes — CI and the
  Makefile use `--frozen` unconditionally.
- The README is the PyPI long description (`pyproject.toml`
  `readme = "README.md"`); relative screenshot paths already did not render on
  PyPI, so the diet does not regress it.

## Example

A user asks "how do I upgrade the compose Postgres volume?" — the README
Configuration section links the docs Database page;
`https://soju06.github.io/codex-lb/database/` carries the verbatim 16→18
runbook and links the `database-backends` / `database-migrations` specs for the
normative behavior.
