# data-retention Specification

## Purpose

Define opt-in retention of request logs and usage history — dashboard-first configuration, safety floors, and pruning invariants — so aged rows can be deleted without losing lifetime totals, latest-known usage, or unfolded data.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Retention is opt-in and validated

Retention MUST be disabled by default. Retention windows are resolved per
source with dashboard-first precedence: a non-NULL
`dashboard_settings.request_log_retention_days` /
`dashboard_settings.usage_history_retention_days` value MUST win; when the
dashboard value is NULL the corresponding deprecated env alias
(`CODEX_LB_REQUEST_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` /
`CODEX_LB_USAGE_HISTORY_RETENTION_DAYS`) MUST apply; when neither is set
retention MUST be disabled. At every layer the value `0` means disabled.

The dashboard settings API MUST expose, per retention window, the read-only
*effective* value (`requestLogRetentionDays` / `usageHistoryRetentionDays`)
alongside the nullable stored *override*
(`requestLogRetentionOverrideDays` / `usageHistoryRetentionOverrideDays`,
`null` = inherit). Updates MUST use only the override fields with tri-state
semantics: a field absent from the payload leaves the stored value unchanged;
a field present with `null` MUST clear the override back to inherit; a field
present with a value MUST store it as the override — including a value equal
to the current effective (env-inherited) value, which deliberately captures
it as a dashboard override. Because overrides round-trip verbatim (null in,
null out), a full GET-then-PUT save echoing the override fields unchanged
MUST NOT alter the stored values.

Both the env validators and the dashboard settings API MUST accept `0`
(disabled) or values at or above their safety floors (30 days for request
logs, 45 days for usage history) up to 3650; configurations between 1 and the
floor MUST be rejected — at startup for env values, with a validation error
for dashboard API updates.

#### Scenario: Default configuration deletes nothing

- **GIVEN** neither retention setting is configured in the dashboard or the environment
- **WHEN** the retention job runs
- **THEN** no rows are deleted from `request_logs`, `usage_history`, or `additional_usage_history`

#### Scenario: Unsafe env retention values fail fast

- **WHEN** an operator sets `request_log_retention_days=7` or `usage_history_retention_days=10`
- **THEN** settings validation MUST raise an error at startup naming the violated floor

#### Scenario: Unsafe dashboard retention values are rejected

- **WHEN** a dashboard settings update carries `requestLogRetentionOverrideDays=7` or `usageHistoryRetentionOverrideDays=10`
- **THEN** the API MUST reject the update with a validation error (the internal validator message names the violated floor, mirroring the env validator's wording)
- **AND** the stored settings MUST remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Full-save echoes round-trip inherit unchanged

- **GIVEN** no dashboard override exists and an env alias supplies the effective retention
- **WHEN** a client performs a full GET-then-PUT save echoing `requestLogRetentionOverrideDays: null` back
- **THEN** the stored value remains `NULL = inherit`, so later changes to the deprecated env alias still take effect

#### Scenario: An explicit override equal to the env alias is stored

- **GIVEN** `CODEX_LB_REQUEST_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=90` and no dashboard override
- **WHEN** a client PUTs `requestLogRetentionOverrideDays: 90`
- **THEN** the override MUST be stored (the effective value stays 90 but no longer tracks the env alias)

#### Scenario: Present-null clears an override back to inherit

- **GIVEN** a stored dashboard override and `CODEX_LB_REQUEST_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=90`
- **WHEN** a client PUTs `requestLogRetentionOverrideDays: null`
- **THEN** the stored value MUST return to `NULL = inherit` and the effective value MUST fall back to 90

#### Scenario: Dashboard value overrides the env alias

- **GIVEN** `CODEX_LB_REQUEST_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=90` and a dashboard value of `30`
- **WHEN** the retention job runs
- **THEN** the request-log cutoff MUST be computed from 30 days

#### Scenario: Dashboard zero disables retention despite the env alias

- **GIVEN** `CODEX_LB_USAGE_HISTORY_RETENTION_DAYS=45` and a dashboard value of `0`
- **WHEN** the retention job runs
- **THEN** no `usage_history` rows are deleted

#### Scenario: Env alias applies while the dashboard value is unset

- **GIVEN** a NULL dashboard value and `CODEX_LB_REQUEST_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=30`
- **WHEN** the retention job runs
- **THEN** the request-log cutoff MUST be computed from 30 days

### Requirement: Request-log pruning never deletes unfolded rows

Request-log pruning MUST gate on every usage-rollup watermark — the lifetime `folded_through`, the time-axis `hourly_folded_through`, and the conversation satellite's `conversation_folded_through` — combined as their minimum. Pruning MUST run only while the combined fold is current (the minimum watermark within two fold lags of now) and MUST delete only rows with `requested_at` older than the retention cutoff AND at least one fold lag below the minimum watermark, so concurrent summary readers holding a slightly older watermark can never lose rows from a just-folded window and no rollup is ever robbed of raw it has not folded. When no rollup watermark exists, or any fold is catching up (initial backfill, stalled scheduler), request-log pruning MUST be skipped.

#### Scenario: Unfolded rows survive pruning

- **GIVEN** a request-log row older than the retention cutoff whose `requested_at` is above any fold watermark
- **WHEN** the retention job runs
- **THEN** the row MUST NOT be deleted

#### Scenario: Stalled fold suspends pruning

- **GIVEN** any fold watermark older than two fold lags
- **WHEN** the retention job runs with request-log retention enabled
- **THEN** no `request_logs` rows are deleted

#### Scenario: Conversation backfill suspends pruning

- **GIVEN** a deployment upgraded with existing history, where the lifetime and hourly watermarks are current but `conversation_folded_through` is still at or near the epoch
- **WHEN** the retention job runs with request-log retention enabled
- **THEN** no `request_logs` rows are deleted until the conversation backfill watermark becomes current

#### Scenario: Lifetime totals are unchanged by pruning

- **GIVEN** folded request-log rows older than the retention cutoff
- **WHEN** the retention job deletes them and account usage summaries are read afterwards
- **THEN** per-account lifetime totals MUST equal their pre-pruning values

#### Scenario: Conversation statistics are unchanged by pruning

- **GIVEN** request-log rows folded into the conversation presence satellite and older than the retention cutoff
- **WHEN** the retention job deletes them
- **THEN** the switched distinct-conversation reads over the pruned period MUST equal their pre-pruning values

#### Scenario: Pruning is skipped before the first fold

- **GIVEN** no `account_usage_rollup_state` row exists
- **WHEN** the retention job runs with request-log retention enabled
- **THEN** no `request_logs` rows are deleted

### Requirement: Usage-history pruning preserves each identity's latest row

Usage-history pruning MUST delete only rows older than the retention cutoff and MUST always retain each identity's latest row per `(account_id, coalesce(window,'primary'))` in `usage_history` and per `(account_id, quota_key, window)` in `additional_usage_history`, regardless of age. "Latest" MUST follow the readers' ordering — newest `recorded_at`, protecting every row tied at that timestamp — not insertion order, so backfilled out-of-chronology rows cannot displace the last-known sample. On SQLite, the bulk-history cache MUST be invalidated after pruning.

#### Scenario: Idle account keeps its last-known usage

- **GIVEN** an account whose only usage rows are older than the retention cutoff
- **WHEN** the retention job runs
- **THEN** the newest row per window for that account MUST remain
- **AND** older rows for the same window MUST be deleted

#### Scenario: Out-of-chronology inserts keep the true latest sample

- **GIVEN** an identity whose highest-id row carries an older `recorded_at` than an earlier-inserted row
- **WHEN** the retention job runs
- **THEN** the row with the newest `recorded_at` MUST remain

### Requirement: Retention runs leader-gated in bounded batches

The retention job MUST run on at most one instance at a time and MUST delete
in bounded batches, each committed in its own transaction, so a large backlog
never holds one long transaction. The scheduler MUST re-evaluate the
effective retention configuration on every tick through the runtime-settings
path, so a dashboard change (enable, disable, or window change) takes effect
without a process restart; ticks whose effective configuration disables
retention MUST NOT run a pass.

#### Scenario: Backlog is pruned incrementally

- **GIVEN** more prunable rows than one batch
- **WHEN** a retention pass runs
- **THEN** rows are deleted across multiple bounded transactions until no prunable rows remain

#### Scenario: Enabling retention from the dashboard needs no restart

- **GIVEN** a running instance with retention disabled
- **WHEN** an operator sets a dashboard retention window
- **THEN** a subsequent scheduler tick runs a retention pass without a restart

#### Scenario: Disabled effective retention skips the pass

- **GIVEN** dashboard and env retention both resolve to 0
- **WHEN** the scheduler ticks
- **THEN** no retention pass runs

### Requirement: Disabled request-log pruning is explained and presets are non-destructive

When the effective request-log retention value is `0`, the Settings data retention card SHALL show neutral informational text that request-log pruning is disabled, logs are retained indefinitely, and storage will grow over time, and SHALL offer 30-day and 90-day request-log retention presets. The informational text MUST NOT characterize disabled pruning as unsafe or direct the operator to change it. Activating a preset MUST update only the local request-log retention form value and MUST NOT persist any setting until the operator activates the existing explicit save action. Rendering the information and presets MUST NOT change the stored override or any other retention policy.

#### Scenario: Effective disabled state shows information and presets

- **GIVEN** effective request-log retention is `0`
- **WHEN** an operator views the data retention card
- **THEN** the card explains neutrally that request-log pruning is disabled and
  logs are retained indefinitely
- **AND** the text notes that storage will grow over time without directing the
  operator to change the policy
- **AND** the card offers 30-day and 90-day request-log retention presets
- **AND** no settings update is submitted

#### Scenario: Preset selection requires explicit save

- **GIVEN** effective request-log retention is `0`
- **WHEN** an operator activates the 30-day or 90-day preset
- **THEN** the request-log retention form value changes to the selected number
- **AND** no settings update is submitted until the operator activates save
- **AND** usage-history retention remains unchanged

#### Scenario: Enabled effective policy does not show disabled-state information

- **GIVEN** effective request-log retention is greater than `0`
- **WHEN** an operator views the data retention card
- **THEN** the disabled-state information and presets are not shown
